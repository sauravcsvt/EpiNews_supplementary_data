Illegal water connections at the locality are learnt to be the reason behind the disease outbreak. Victim Aryan's father Ashok Kumar is a labourer. On Thursday morning, teams of MC and health department rushed to Gandhi Camp dominated by low-caste communities and took stock of situation. The health teams conducted a survey at about half a dozen streets near Bhagat Kabir temple and distributed 6,000 chlorine tablets to the residents. The locality has a population of over 10,000. The health department also held a medical camp during which around 200 residents who complained of vomiting and dysentery were given medicines free of cost. Sewage at the locality remained choked in the recent past while garbage is dumped near railway tracks in the open. Sukhbir, a resident of the locality, said his 10-year-old daughter was also suffering from vomiting for last few days after consuming contaminated water. He said sewage and drains remained choked in their streets but no officials and ward councillor came to take stock of the situation. Dilip Kumar, another resident suffering from vomiting, said no concrete steps were taken even after residents complained of sewage choking, garbage dumping and supply of contaminated drinking water in their area. Former councillor Rakesh Kumar Bhagat said, \"It is the duty of the area councillor to inform the municipal corporation about the problems the residents are facing.\" On the other hand, Jatinder Jind, BJP councillor Sulekha Bhagat's husband, said, \"It is an attempt to malign our party's image since the child died of some other disease.\" PS Jaggi, superintending engineer of MCJ, said, \"We have discontinued 22 temporary water connections which were nearby sewer pipes. We have started a survey to trace illegal water connections at Gandhi Camp locality.\" He said water tankers had been moved to the locality and the residents would be provided water from these tankers by the time fault in the water pipelines was not detected. Civil surgeon Dr RL Bassan said, \"Illegal water connections, choked sewer pipes and drains besides garbage dumped in the open are responsible for the disease outbreak in the area.\" The district administration and the Municipal Corporation Jalandhar (MCJ) have failed to learn any lesson from the cholera outbreak at Garha in which four persons had died and more than 600 were taken ill in September last year. The authorities had claimed that action would be taken against those found using illegal water connections but nothing concrete has been done in this direction so far. Moreover, a lax attitude on the part of the civic body can be gauged from the fact that the health department had collected water samples from the same locality a few days ago. The samples had failed quality test and a report in this regard was also sent to the MC asking it to act accordingly but no action was taken. Survey held, samples taken Health teams surveyed 310 houses covering 1,580 residents on Thursday morning. The teams found five cases of fever, three of diarrhoea. The patients were referred to the civil hospital 9,000 chlorine tablets were distributed; two water samples were taken.MC officials said there are 980 water connections at Gandhi camp and around 20 per cent are of these are illegal."}

XXXXXX  Letters\nStudents fall sick in unhygienic, damp school buildings\nVacation up to 8th class from Nov 24 not sufficient, all schools be closed with immediate effect: Experts\nFollow up flood aftermath\nM HYDERI\nSrinagar, Nov 14: What was feared to be repercussion of keeping flood-hit schools open has started risking lives of students in this devastated City.\u00a0 Scores of schoolchildren are falling sick with medicos blaming it on the unhygienic conditions and dampness in the educational institutions. Though government has announced vacations up to 8th standard from Nov 24, experts said there was immediate need to announce vacation for all classes to prevent spread of any disease.\nMedical experts have cautioned that schooling in prevalent conditions was simply risking the lives of students.\nWhile the administration has been reluctant to go for \u0093untimely closure\u0094 of schools in worst-hit Srinagar district, the students seem to be the cannon fodder for a rosy picture of the City, where the administration, as per flood victims, miserably failed in rescue, relief and rehabilitation of the affected.\nThough the lower classes are scheduled to be closed from November 24 till February 23, 2015, experts have sought immediate closure of schools upto higher secondary level.\nTHE HEALTH ALARM\nIn the past around a month scores of students have fallen sick after complaining of ailments like vomiting, diarrhea, fever and cough. \u0093I was apprehensive of sending my son to school, which, hit by floods looked unsafe. But as the administration kept the schools open I couldn\u0092t find any options but to send him there only to get bedridden,\u0094 complained a parent, a medico in the Government Medical College(GMC). She said her son studying in class 10th is suffering from severe diarrhea, vomiting and high fever despite medication.\nApart from the unhygienic conditions, the dampness has left the school buildings colder than routine. \u0093Children literally shiver in the classrooms but then there are no alternatives.\u0094\nA teacher at a leading school pleading anonymity said almost 30 of the total of 40 odd students in her classroom have fallen sick due to\u00a0 infections they acquired at schools. \u0093Symptoms of ailments had a cascading effect on almost all the students\u0085 But we have been directed by the school authorities not to disclose it to anyone,\u0094 she said.\nMEDICO SPEAKS\nNoted pediatrician Dr Altaf Hussain said such cases have been coming to him for treatment. He said the \u0093adverse circumstances\u0094 past floods have aggregated the infections which would otherwise prevail during the season.\n\u0093At this time of the season you do have viral infections but this time it got aggravated by adverse circumstances like school buildings being damp and inadequate heating arrangements...\u00a0 Let\u0092s not forget that government schools in general have no heating arrangements,\u0094 Dr Altaf told Greater Kashmir.\u00a0 \u0093I do see quite a few respiratory cases.\u0094\nDAK CONCERNED\nNoted physician and Doctors Association of Kashmir President Dr Nisar Ul Hassan said: \u0093Despite uproar from parents and medical experts that schools are not safe, despite an alert that schools have not been disinfected scientifically, schools were kept open\u0085 Whosoever is responsible for keeping schools open without disinfecting them properly should be booked for criminal activity as it concerns health of fragile children.\u0094\n\u0093How can the authorities be silent on the issue which is affecting health of our children while parents are helpless,\u0094 he added.\n\u0093As if infections will verify age of children before targeting them... This is ridiculous to think that unhygienic and cold conditions amid infective dampness will only affect health of students of upto 8th standard alone,\u0094 he added.\nLAWYER\u0092S VIEWPOINT\nA legal expert said the government was bound to provide safe and healthy life to its people more so to children.\n\u0093It is civil liability. Everybody is guaranteed safe and healthy life, more so children. It\u0092s duty of the government to ensure safety more so towards children because they are more vulnerable to infections,\u0094 he said.\nHe said apart from Directorate of School\u00a0 Education Kashmir and the Divisional Commissioner Kashmir, Director Health, the District Development Commissioner and the Commissioner Srinagar Municipal Corporation were \u0093answerable for the maladministration which has jeopardized the life of students.\u0094\n\u0093Till now it\u0092s a civil case but if anything untoward happens because of the administrative negligence it\u0092s going to be a criminal liability.\u0094\nMASS PROMOTION NEEDED\nExperts said solution to the problem which is affecting lives of schoolchildren is that students of classes other than those who have to face Board exams were given mass promotion and winter vacations announced for all classes without any further delay. \u0093The students of most of the schools have already appeared in three tests. They can be promoted to new classes on the basis of their internal assessment. What\u0092s the big deal?\u0094 asked an educationist.\n\u0093Moreover when the children have lost everything including books to floods, what\u0092s the fun of so called schooling? The only benefit of schooling at the cost of life of schoolchildren is that the administration is giving a rosy picture of its mounting failures,\u0094 he added.\nHIGH COURT INTERVENTION\nA division bench of the state High Court comprising Chief Justice MM Kumar and Justice Ali Muhammad Magrey\nis already hearing a Public Interest Litigation on structural safety and hygienic conditions of the schools past floods.\nIn the latest on Nov 3, the J&K Government declared 72 more school buildings in Kashmir as unhygienic, taking the number of such institutions in the Valley to 347.\nThe report, drafted on the basis of the information furnished by Chief Medical Officer, revealed that out of 24 more schools visited in the City, 17 were found hygienically unfit.\nEarlier, in a separate status report submitted in the High Court, the Education department revealed that the total number of schools in Kashmir is 11,662 out of which 1096 school buildings were affected by the floods, with 495 buildings completely damaged.\nDSEK ENDEAVOR\nOfficial sources said it was because of the personal intervention of the Director Education Tariq Ali Mir that schools upto class 8th would be closed for winter vacations from November 24 till February 23, 2015 while higher classes would go on vacations from December 8.\nThey said some days back prompted by public complaints the Director Education proposed to the government for early closure of schools.\n\u0093But some classes are being kept functional as some officials in the administration do not want to give a notion that all schools have been closed because of the flood aftermath. They want the schools to be on for a rosy picture of the devastation and failures,\u0094 said a source privy to such discussions.\nLastupdate on : Fri, 14 Nov 2014 21:30:00 Makkah time\nLastupdate on : Fri, 14 Nov 2014 18:30:00 GMT\nLastupdate on : Sat, 15 Nov 2014 00:00:00 IST\n\n XXXXXX  GreaterKashmir.com"}

Death due to dengue is totally preventable as all one needs is to keep your surroundings clean,\u201d said a senior doctor in the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).\nAs per the data available, most cases have been reported from south Delhi this year. So far, the north corporation has reported 18 dengue cases, the south corporation 39 and east corporation 13.

According to records at the civil surgeon's office, so far, 65 cases have been reported in this season, but none of them have been reported from the Ludhiana civil hospital. A majority of the cases include those from private hospitals or from civil hospitals of Khanna, Jagraon, and other nearby areas, but absolutely no cases are coming from the Ludhiana Civil Hospital this year.\nAbhishek, a patient who had all the symptoms of malaria got himself tested twice at the civil hospital, but both the times, the reports were negative. On not getting a solution for his symptoms, when he approached a diagnostic centre outside the hospital, he was found positive for malaria. Later, he took medication from a private doctor.\nIn the light of such cases coming up every day at the civil hospital, it's completely illogical to depend on the civil hospital laboratory for diagnosis, and treatment from the hospital later. Dr Bindu Nalwa, biochemist and in-charge of the laboratory at the hospital said: \"Actually, whatever cases come to us, they come after two to three days of medication from other doctors or quacks, which results in failure of the slide test.\"\nNow, the question arises that if 40 slides are being tested everyday at the civil hospital, and all other hospitals are reporting malaria cases, how is it possible that the civil hospital does not receive any patient affected with malaria, even during the monsoon season? Senior medical officer at the hospital, Dr RK Karkara, was unavailable for comment. However, district epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said: \"All these cases include malaria from different parts of the district, and other districts like Khanna and Jagraon. But we have not been receiving any case of malaria from the Ludhiana civil hospital. We do send a few samples to Chandigarh and Patiala, but the labs there too have reported those slides as negative.\" A few doctors in the city, however, said that it is quite possible that if the hospital delayed sending the reports, the bacteria may be dead by that time, resulting in the reports turning out to be negative.\nIt is to be noted that in 2013, there were 210 malaria cases reported in the city. However, there has been no check till now by the authorities as to why only 65 cases are reported this year, but none from the civil hospital. It could only be said that if you don't want to know you are having malaria, get yourself tested at the civil hospital and go back home happily. What happens afterwards is your responsibility. Treatment is delayed in most of the cases due to this false diagnosis.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=senior medical officer,Mahavir Civil Hospital Ludhiana,Lab technician,Jagraon hospital,civil surgeon\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Mayor Mahabala Marla said he will look into the issue.\nDistrict Health Officer H.S. Shivakumar said that there were some hiccups in the mechanism of reporting and that they were trying to set it right.\nIt was on August 21 that the Health Department introduced the system of sending SMS from the testing centres about malaria, dengue or any other viral disease.\nIn Bolar, medical reports available with the victims suggest that on August 21 18-year-old Sagar reported positive for dengue at a laboratory in Falnir.\nThe same day, another resident, Manoj (18), staying in the house adjoining Sagar\u2019s, was found positive for dengue by a private hospital.\nAfter a few days, Manoj\u2019s mother Neela Ramesh also tested positive for dengue, followed by his sister, 16-year-old Tanmaya, who is now undergoing medical treatment.\nAnother resident, Shashirekha (30), who was diagnosed of dengue on August 28, has recovered from fever. A medical student and a tenant of Sagar\u2019s who has fever now is yet to undergo tests.\n\u201cWe have not seen any of the health workers coming to the area,\u201d said Sagar\u2019s father, Nitin Bhandari.\nOn Monday, Mr. Bhandari brought the issue of stagnant water in an adjoining site to the notice of the local councillor, who, in turn, informed the Malaria Cell in the city corporation.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

Sixteen dengue cases have already been reported from areas under the jurisdiction of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The MBCs, under contract with the three civic bodies, have alleged that the corporations are yet to settle the pending dues and enroll them as regular employees even after the Lieutenant-Governor's directive. According to a circular issued to the trifurcated MCD from the L-G's office, workers who have been under contract with the corporation for more than 17 years are to be regularized. They are to get a monthly salary of Rs 15,790 as against their contractual payment of Rs 7,350 per month. After the MCD's trifurcation, 1,280, 1,200 and 720 MBCs were assigned to the south, north, and east municipal corporations, respectively. \"Every time in the last few months, whenever we have approached the corporation to reimburse our pending dues, they have given excuses like shortage of funds and other false promises,\" an agitating worker said. According to civic sources, many of the government hospitals are yet to prepare themselves to face the cases of mosquito-borne diseases. Last year, there were more than 5,500 dengue cases reported in Delhi and the National Capital Region. Mail Today had rigorously reported on the chaos that took the capital by storm. According to a recent report issued by the civic bodies, dengue cases have drastically risen in the last three years. But the civic bodies maintained that the situation was under control. \"The preventive measures have been taken and we are on schedule with all the awareness campaigns,\" a north corporation official said.

While Type I and III are the most common in Delhi, patterns change every few years. Last year we had identified considerable number of Type II for the first time since 1996,\u201d a microbiologist from AIIMS explained.\n\u201cThe Type II strain is known to cause severe symptoms such as haemorrhagic fever and shock. But after a few initial cases, we saw more of Type I and III\u00a0 last year. But if any strain is diagnosed late, especially after blood platelet levels start falling, it can lead to severe symptoms,\u201d the microbiologist said.\nThis year, serological tests are yet to be conducted to identify the strain of the virus.\nMeanwhile,10 cases of malaria have been confirmed this year \u2014 one in June against 28 cases last year, of which 11 were in June.\n\u201cMalaria cases seem to be in control this year compared to the last few years. We are maintaining due vigilance but looking at trends from the last few years, we are likely to see a lull in malaria cases this year,\u201d a municipal corporation official explained.\nTags:\n\n XXXXXX  Indian Express"}

Sonal, Head of the Department of Malaria, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) under the health ministry, told IANS.\n\nHe said the builders and industrialists should ensure proper disposal of waste and construction material to avoid mosquito breeding.\n\n\"They should consult the health department while planning the buildings and their construction,\" he said.\n\nMalaria is caused by a bite from an infected female Anopheles mosquito which breeds in dirty and stagnant water.\n\nSonal said India recorded around 45,000 deaths due to malaria in 2010. \"While the overall figures might have gone down for the country as a whole, cases have gone up in urban areas,\" he added.\n\nMore than 2.2 billion people are at risk of malaria in the Asia-Pacific region, which represents 67 percent of the world population at risk of malaria. Six of the 10 countries worldwide with the largest populations at risk, including India, are located in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nOf the 35 countries that account for 98 percent of malaria deaths, five are located in the Asia-Pacific region and account for approximately 93 percent of the death toll in the region. India alone accounts for 38 percent of regional mortality. (The other four countries are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea.)\n\nAccording to experts, simple steps like using mosquito nets, removing stagnant water and not allowing garbage to accumulate can prevent thousands of deaths due to malaria in India.\n\nSaid Raman Abhi, senior consultant and unit head, Internal Medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI), Gurgaon: \"With the onset of summer, it is only likely that there would be a rise in the number of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria, depending on the type of mosquito.\"\n\n\"Ensure that water does not stagnate in open containers, tyres and desert coolers, report to appropriate authorities for disinfection of open garbage dumps, use kerosene on stagnant water where draining is not possible and use mosquito repellents and mosquito nets,\" Abhi told IANS.\n\nFour different types of malaria - p-vivax, p-falciparum, p-ovale and p-malariae - affect humans. Of these, the first two are commonly found in the Indian sub-continent while the other two are prevalent in African countries.\n\n\"While vivax can be easily treated by the administration of chloroquinine, falciparum could have complications. If not treated in time, this form of the disease can affect the brain or the kidney,\" Abhi said.\n\nDespite the massive burden of the disease, the currently available funding for malaria is far below the resources required to reach universal coverage of interventions. An estimated $5.1 billion is needed every year for this purpose.\n\nIn 2012, the global total of international and domestic funding for malaria was $2.5 billion - less than half of what is needed."}

Internet-based surveillance could help predict infectious diseases outbreak   Recipients' Email:   Researchers have claimed that internet-based surveillance can help detect infectious diseases like Dengue Fever and Influenza up to two weeks earlier than traditional surveillance methods.  Senior author of the paper titled Internet-based surveillance systems for monitoring emerging infectious diseases, QUT Senior Research Fellow Dr Wenbiao Hu said that when investigating the occurrence of epidemics, spikes in searches for information about infectious diseases could accurately predict outbreaks of that disease.  Dr Hu, based at QUT's Institute for Health and Biomedical Innovation, said there was often a lag time of two weeks before traditional surveillance methods could detect an emerging infectious disease.  He said that this is because traditional surveillance relies on the patient recognising the symptoms and seeking treatment before diagnosis, along with the time taken for health professionals to alert authorities through their health networks.  Hu said that in contrast, digital surveillance can provide real-time detection of epidemics.  He said the study found by using digital surveillance through search engine algorithms such as Google Trends and Google Insights, detecting the 2005-06 avian influenza outbreak \"Bird Flu\" would have been possible between one and two weeks earlier than official surveillance reports.

The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) reported 48 dengue and 70 malaria deaths in the state in 2013. NVBDCP director Dr Ashish Dhariwal explains why. \u201cUnregulated construction activity, elevated levels of migration to the city and poor water storage facilities are the main reasons,\u201d he said. Mumbai, then, should be a sitting duck. \u201cIt has many abandoned textile mills and rail and ship yards that are ideal breeding grounds for the dengue mosquito,\" Dhariwal said. With the outbreak of the disease in rural Maharashtra, Haryana and Karnataka, the situation is turning out to be even more alarming. Till now, dengue was widely believed to be restricted mostly to metropolitan cities. So far in 2014, Maharashtra has recorded lesser number of dengue cases (132) than Kerala (380) and Tamil Nadu (339). That's cold comfort. For one, \u201cthough dengue has become a global phenomenon, there are no drugs or vaccines available to curtail the disease.\u201d Dhariwal says. \u201cMumbai's proximity to the coast and rains are the other factors. We have seen prolific breeding of dengue mosquito in big cities,\u201d he explains. On malaria also, the state doesn't have much hope. The annual incidence of malaria is higher in Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, but Maharashtra has more deaths. However, India is doing much better in mosquito control than Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. But dengue remains a challenge, Dhariwal admits. A total of 359 malaria deaths and 167 dengue deaths were reported across India in 2013. This year, there have been seven malaria deaths and two dengue-related deaths, both in Kerala. Deaths due to dengue: Maharashtra \u2013 48 Kerala \u2013 25 Gujarat \u2013 15 Deaths due to Malaria: Maharashtra \u2013 70 Orissa \u2013 66 Meghalaya \u2013 62 Though dengue is a global phenomenon as mosquitoes breeds inside houses and there are no drugs or vaccines available to curtail the disease."}

Continuous efforts and dedication has made it come true. Not a single case of death due to malaria has been reported in the Lanjigarh block of the district in the past two years. Moreover, the cases of pediatric malaria have gone down by around 50% over the past few years. Joint efforts by the district medical unit and Vedanta Aluminium at Lanjigarh have been able to script this success story. According to Dr. Sabita Swain, Chief Medical Officer, Vedanta Aluminium Limited, \"The medical unit from Vedanta Aluminum and the district medical team have been working relentlessly on spreading awareness about the ill-effects of mosquito biting and the benefits of keeping their surroundings clean. This has resulted in a sharp drop in cases of malaria amidst children and pregnant women.\" According to experts, the block is a part of the malaria endemic zone and most adults here carry traces of malaria parasite in their blood. Thus, reduction in pediatric malaria cases is a critical indicator of a better future as it confirms that the future generation will not have to live with the parasite being a permanent feature in their blood stream. \"Zero malaria death in the block is a great achievement. The awareness programmes taken up jointly by the health department and Vedanta Aluminium have been able to deliver good results,\" says Dr. Swapna Sarit, Block Medical Officer, Lanjigarh. The malaria awareness campaign launched by Vedanta Aluminium has played a vital role in achieving the feat in the block, and it is well supported by the Vedanta Hospital at Lanjigarh. The hospital has an outreach of 50 kms across Kalahandi and Rayagada districts and provides state-of-art facilities to tribal and local communities of the region. Moreover, each family from the core villages has been provided health cards to maintain health history. Over 5000 such cards have been distributed so far in 34 villages. With a vision to change the ground realities related to health issues in Kalahandi district, which is infamous for malnourishment, poverty, malaria deaths and poor medical infrastructure, the Vedanta Hospital aims at providing quality healthcare facility to all and educate people about the necessity of maintaining hygiene and sanitation. The hospital also conducts regular health surveys to obtain health history of every family in and around Lanjigarh which has been quite helpful in better treatment of people of the area. More than 129,000 patients have been treated at the hospital since December 2010.

So people should not ignore if they have fever and should continue to get checked if the dengue symptoms persist,\u201d said Dr Bansal.\nWith the winter settling in and people starting to wear covered clothes, it is likely that dengue cases will drop.\n\u201cIn the past one week, we have seen a decline in dengue cases in both the OPD and wards. The cases will further come down as the cold settles in,\u201d said Dr A P Dubey, Head of the Department, Paediatric Unit, Lok Nayak Hospital.\n\n XXXXXX  Deccan Herald"}

The national capital is not far behind with an sudden increase in the number of cases with the onset of winter. Two deaths due to dengue have been reported this year in Delhi. Not only the residential buildings but also the government offices have become breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. What presents an alarming picture is the fact that even the Civic Centre \u2013 which houses the headquarters of the North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations, and the ever-crowded Lok Nayak Hospital \u2013 have been found to be breeding grounds for such mosquitoes. (Read: Dengue prevention \u2014 10 tips to stay safe from the disease ) In this week the number of cases reported was 98, whereas the total number of cases before November 1 was 438. 87 cases were reported before September this year. Nearly 50% of these cases have been reported from south Delhi which seems to be worst hit area. The civic bodies in Delhi are on a spree of prosecuting people for not keeping their premises mosquito free to curb this menace. Nearly 450 government offices, schools, hospitals and police stations have been penalized in Delhi for not taking preventing measures against mosquito breeding grounds. 2,246 dengue cases were reported till October 31, in 2010. Over the years, the case fatality rate (CFR) was brought down from 3.3 per cent in 1996 to 0.4 per cent in 2010. It again increased to 0.9 per cent in 2011 and then reduced to 0.5 in 2012. Rapid urbanisation and bad water management, including improper water storage practices in urban, semi-urban and rural areas, lead to proliferation of mosquito-breeding sites and increase the risk of dengue.

Despite the Union government\u2019s acknowledgement that this vector-borne disease is a major threat in urban and rural areas, it seems the national strategy to deal with dengue has failed.\u00a0 With the onset of winter, the situation is getting worse in the National Capital. There has been a sudden spurt in the number of dengue cases in Delhi.\u00a0 At the centre of the deadly menace are the dengue and malaria-spreading mosquitoes. From residential homes to swanky government offices in Delhi, these mosquitoes seem to be everywhere.\u00a0 Two deaths due to dengue have been reported this year in Delhi.\u00a0 What presents an alarming picture is the fact that even the Civic Centre - which houses the headquarters of the North and South Delhi Municipal Corporations, and the ever-crowded Lok Nayak Hospital - have been found to be breeding grounds for such mosquitoes.\u00a0 Around 438 cases of dengue have been reported in the Capital before November 1. While 87 cases were reported before September this year, in this week itself 98 dengue cases have been reported. The worst affected is South Delhi, where nearly half of the total dengue cases have been reported.\u00a0 While 205 dengue patients are from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation areas, the number of dengue cases in North and East Delhi is 84 and 73, respectively.\u00a0 Around a dozen dengue cases have been reported from Lutyen\u2019s Delhi as well.\u00a0 As the numbers rise, the civic bodies in Delhi are prosecuting people for not keeping their premises mosquito-free. Nearly 450 government offices, schools, hospitals and police stations have been penalized in Delhi for not doing enough to stop breeding of mosquitoes in their premises.\u00a0 While 205 government institutions have been challaned in the SDMC areas, 97 government offices in North and over a hundred institutions in East Delhi have been prosecuted.\u00a0 \u201cApart from checking for dengue in the residential houses, we have focused on government offices and other public places. Mosquitoes have been detected in the Lok Nayak Hospital, Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital, railway stations and several schools. This poses a huge threat to people frequenting these places,\u201d said North Delhi Municipal Commissioner Praveen Kumar Gupta.\u00a0 Mosquitoes were also found to be breeding on the ground floor of D Block in Civic Centre, for which the building in-charge has been issued a challan.\u00a0 Gupta said 13,236 households have been challaned, while legal notices have been issued to over 1.12 lakh households.\u00a0 However, the number of cases this year has been relatively low compared to the previous years. About 318 dengue cases were reported before October this year, as against 2,442 during the corresponding period in 2013, 951 in 2012 and 512 in 2011.\u00a0 In 2010 a maximum of 2,246 dengue cases were reported till October 31. Over the years, the case fatality rate (CFR) \u2014 which was 3.3 per cent in 1996 \u2014 had come down to 0.4 per cent in 2010, 0.9 per cent in 2011 and 0.5 in 2012.\u00a0 However, the risk of dengue has increased in recent years due to rapid urbanisation and bad water management, including improper water storage practices in urban, semi-urban and rural areas, leading to proliferation of mosquito-breeding sites.\u00a0 The cases peak after monsoon and are not uniformly distributed throughout the year. But in the southern states and in Gujarat the disease is a perennial problem.\u00a0 Dengue is endemic in 34 states and Union Territories. Tamil Nadu reported highest number of deaths in 2012 (66 deaths) followed by Maharashtra (59). Facing the threat of dengue, Puducherry is taking steps to combat the situation.\u00a0 Puducherry Welfare and Tourism Minister P. Rajavelu on Wednesday instructed officials to ensure that speedy steps are initiated to prevent dengue.\u00a0 Patna civic body lost for words\u00a0 By\u00a0Giridhar Jha in Patna\u00a0 Health officials in Bihar are a worried lot after 69 cases were reported from different parts of Patna alone in the past few days.\u00a0 Principal secretary (Health) Deepak Kumar, who visited Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) to take stock of the situation on Tuesday, expressed concern over the rapid spread of the disease.\u00a0 An alarmed health administration has joined hands with the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to undertake a joint exercise to check the spread of the disease.\u00a0 Beginning on Wednesday, the two agencies have launched an extensive fogging and cleanliness drive to contain dengue, especially in those areas where new cases have been reported in the past couple of days. The health secretary, who visited the dengue ward at the hospital, inquired about the availability of the ELISA kits which are used for confirmation of the disease and directed the PMCH authorities to make available medicines free of cost to the patients.\u00a0 The PMC, however, is apparently ill-equipped to deal with the situation arising out of the situation. Out of the four large fogging machines, three are at present out of order while only 17 of the 53 hand-held fogging machines remain in working condition.\u00a0 This has made the task rather difficult for the PMC since the cases have been reported from diverse localities.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the patients admitted to the PMCH alleged that the PMC had never undertaken any fogging exercise in their areas in recent times which resulted in the spread of dengue on such a large scale. \u00a0 KEM hospital premises are littered with construction waste, providing a ready breeding ground for mosquitoes Fadnavis seeks report on dengue outbreak\u00a0 By Kunal V. Shinde in Mumbai\u00a0 The outbreak of dreaded dengue disease in Mumbai and in other major cities of Maharashtra has alarmed the state administration, with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis expressing concern and seeking a report. According to Mantralaya sources, the chief minister has called for a detailed report and the action taken by the municipal bodies which has seen rise in the dengue cases.\u00a0 Taking cognisance on the spread of the disease, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has also started initiating action against the culprits, who fail to take preventive measures to stop the breeding of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes.\u00a0 As per the data released by the BMC as many as 213 new cases of dengue have been identified in the city itself till the last week of October.\u00a0 \u201cThe BMC has been appealing the people to co-operate with it to tackle the menace of Dengue in the city. Preventive measures should be taken to stop the breeding of mosquitoes\u2019 which are responsible for the spread of Dengue,\u201d a civic official said.\u00a0 Meanwhile, KEM Hospital in Mumbai have become the hotbed for dengue breeding mosquitoes. Last week, the hospital witnessed two dengue-related deaths, one being a third-year resident doctor working at the hospital. And on Wednesday, three more resident doctors at the hospital were tested positive.\u00a0 When Mail Today visited the hospital on Wednesday, heavy fumigation was on across the area.\u00a0 The toilets had been cleaned but some construction debris was still lying around near the casualty area.\u00a0 With inputs from Ayesha Arvind\u00a0 Over 1,170 people infected in MP\u00a0 By Anup Dutta in Bhopal\u00a0 The government and private hospitals in Madhya Pradesh are flooded with dengue patients, with authorities grappling to fight the menace.\u00a0 Nearly two dozen people have been reported dead and over 1,170 being confirmed infected by the mosquito-borne disease in the state recently.\u00a0 To add to the worries of the health department, three cases of dengue were reported in Bhopal in the last 48 hours (Monday and Tuesday), taking the figure to above 490.\u00a0 In a bid to tackle the menace, the Bhopal Muncipal Corporation has set up a control room in Kolar locality which holds the record for the highest number of dengue cases.\u00a0 The Health department has also appointed 900 accredited social health activists (ASHA) workers to check the disease in the state capital and to spread awareness regarding the affected areas.\u00a0 There has been a spurt in dengue cases in other cities and districts as well.\u00a0Indore has registered a total of 65 dengue cases this year, a whopping rise from last year when the figure was only five.\u00a0Similarly, three people have died in Betul and Shivpuri districts.\u00a0 \u201cThe number of cases has increased in the Madhya Pradesh. But if you compare with the other state\u2019s like Orissa, the numbers are comparatively less. Situation is under control, we are monitoring very closely,\" said Pankaj Agrawal, Health Commissioner told Mail Today.\u00a0 Though there are no vaccines or drugs to combat dengue, Vijay Singh an Ayurvedic consultant and in-charge of Sanjivani Ayurveda Centre, a unit set up by Madhya Pradesh said: \u201cSyrup of papaya leaves helps to stop falling levels of blood platelets to an extent but only after proper consultation. Similarly, proper use of Adusa (Adhatoda zeylanica) and Giloy or Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) juices helps to combat dengue .\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 Share or comment on this article Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Spraying of larvicides, especially in institutional areas like schools and hospitals, has been going on,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Yadav.

The municipal corporations are carrying out measures to ensure that breeding of mosquitoes is prevented. \u201cAnti-mosquito activities, including fumigation, cleaning of drains, and checking of mosquito-breeding sites are being undertaken across the Capital. This week the city has reported 22 cases of dengue,\u2019\u2019 said a senior corporation official.

A total of 120 cases had been reported in Delhi till October 4, while the figure stood at 98 till September 27, according to a report released by South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The total number of dengue cases in Delhi has crossed the 100 mark, with an increase of over 20 per cent in the last week alone.

So far the vector-borne disease has claimed just one victim, Rishi Qaddafi, an eight-year-old boy hailing from Srinagar who resided in south Delhi. He died of dengue on Friday at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Over 5,500 dengue cases and six deaths were registered in the national capital last year, according to SDMC, which compiles report for vector-borne diseases in the city. According to a recent report released by North Delhi Municipal Corporation, dengue mosquitoes have been found breeding at various institutions this year, including six cases reported at Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital and three at the headquarters of North Delhi Municipal Corporation itself. DDA, Delhi Technical University and DTC depot are among several institutions in the national capital to be penalised for failing to check breeding of dengue mosquitoes on their premises. Delhi had witnessed a large number of dengue cases in 2010, with over 6,200 cases. In 2009, 1,153 cases were registered, over 1,300 cases in 2008, 1,131 cases in 2011 and 2,093 cases in 2012. The decline in the number of cases this year has been attributed to delayed rains and preventive drive undertaken by the civic bodies much before the onset of monsoon. Civic bodies are continuing with preventive measures like fumigation, checking of breeding areas and awareness campaigns to control dengue menace. According to the report, 1,42,285 households were found positive for mosquito breeding, while legal notices were served to over 1,01,732 for mosquitogenic conditions. Over 11,000 prosecutions were also launched during the same period. Meanwhile, 56 cases of malaria have also been recorded in the city till October 4."}

The total number of cases in Odisha itself has crossed the mark of 2,000. In the month of September, a 36% rise in total dengue cases in Delhi was reported within a week. Besides, this year\u2019s first dengue death case in Delhi has been reported. With a sudden spike in dengue cases, blood banks in almost all parts of the country are grappled with the increasing demands of platelets.\u00a0\nDoctors and health experts are now worried about severe scarcity of platelets this year. Experts also noted that earlier malaria used to be the underlying reason for scarcity of platelets, which has now been overtaken by dengue.\nPlatelets are a crucial component of the blood, which are involved in blood clotting process. The platelet count in healthy individuals is about 1.5 lakh to 3 lakh. In dengue fever, the count can drop to as low as just 10,000- 20,000, which calls for immediate platelet transfusion. For collection of platelets, healthy donors are required. Collection can be done in two ways. A single donor platelets (SDP) involves a machine that extracts platelets from the donor\u2019s blood during the process of donation, and the remaining blood is pumped back to the donor. Inrandom blood platelets (RDP), platelets are extracted from blood that is already being collected at blood banks.\nWhy is there a sudden surge in demand for platelets?\nExperts note that the sudden rise in dengue cases could be due to environmental changes. Factors like intermittent and unpredictable rains and humidity could have lead to change in vector transmission. Apart from that, here are a few more reasons why need for platelets has increased.\nHospitalisation cases for dengue have gone up. Many people are suffering from severe form of dengue.\nThere is a need for increased awareness about increasing platelet demands with a lack of blood and platelet donors. People, in general, are reluctant to donate their platelets. Your blood cells take 3 months to regenerate after a single donation episode but your platelets will regenerate in a span of 15 days after making a donation. Therefore, healthy people should actively come forward and donate their platelets.\nIn many hospitals available platelet stores are being misused. Platelet infusion is being carried out even when the count is between 40,000 and 80,000, which should not be done. Platelets should be administered only when the count has dropped to 10,000 or below. Platelet count should be monitored regularly in dengue patients.\nSymptoms of dengue\nCharacterized by severe flu-like symptoms, dengue affects infants, children and adults alike and could be fatal. The clinical manifestations of dengue vary with the age of the patient.\u00a0 A person suffering from high fever in the range of 40\u00b0C/ 104\u00b0F, accompanied by any two of the following symptoms could be suffering from dengue:\n\n XXXXXX  TheHealthSite"}

First our kids fell ill, then Ratna. I\u2019d never heard of three people in the same family getting struck by dengue together,\u201d says the resident of G-Block, Chittaranjan Park. Dengue cases have been steadily increasing in the Capital over the past four days, with South Delhi being the worst hit. \u201cAll three had fever and were NS1-positive for dengue, but did not need transfusion as there was no active bleeding,\u201d says Dr KK Aggarwal, cardiologist and physician at Moolchand Hospital, who advised they get tested when he saw all three severely dehydrated. Official data from the three municipal corporations is reflecting the trend, with 20 cases in the week ending September 20, taking the numbers from 55 till September 13 to 75 till September 20. South Delhi has reported 34 cases, East and North Delhi nine each, 12 are from areas outside their municipal jurisdictions, and 11 are from the NCR. The real count is always higher. \u201cDengue is usually diagnosed using dengue NS1 antigen test or the dengue-specific IgM & IgG tests, which cost around `2,000 and detect all four strains of the virus. The MCDs insist on the more expensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results which come after three to four days,\u201d says Dr Aggarwal. As many as 17 people have been admitted to Apollo Hospitals since January, of whom five were children. \u201cThis is a fraction of the cases treated each year. This year, the infection is mild and platelet transfusions have been rare, but the number of patients in the OPD with fever are going up now,\u201d says Anupam Sibal, group director of medical service, Apollo Hospitals. \u201cDengue peaks in Delhi-NCR in September and October, so this is the time to use protection against mosquitoes and use repellent creams and patches,\u201d says Dr Sibal. Delhi had 5,574 dengue cases in 2013, shows official municipal data. Dhar suspects the construction site behind his home is the breeding ground for Aedes aegypti mosquito \u2014 the common carrier of both chikungunya and dengue virus. \u201cWe\u2019re careful, but since it\u2019s a day-biting mosquito and my wife and children are home during the day, I suspect they got infected at home.\u201d says Dhar, who deals in imported journals. India reported 5,218 dengue cases till July 31, shows data from the Centre\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. Of 18 dengue-endemic states/UTs in India, the worst affected till the end of July were Kerala and Maharashtra, with 1,181 and 1,150 cases respectively. Delhi had reported 16 cases in the same period."}

Two cases have been reported till March this year, says data collected by the three municipal corporations. Last year, four dengue cases were reported till March 30. One case was reported from North Delhi Municipal Corporation area in March and the other was a person from outside Delhi, confirmed a corporation official. The data, which was collated till March 29, 2014, states that 2,967 houses were found positive for mosquito breeding. The highest number, 2589 houses, was in South Delhi municipal areas, followed by North (256) and East (122). Legal notices were issued to 3,848 individuals for creating an environment suitable for mosquito breeding and 26 were prosecuted. The corporations conducted inspections for domestic breeding in over 81 lakh houses across the city and 5,774 houses were fumigated. \"People are first issued legal notices for creating an environment for mosquito breeding. If they further fail to control mosquito breeding in their area, they are penalised by charging a maximum fine of Rs 500,\" said Y S Mann, spokesperson of the North DMC. The corporation data also shows that just one malaria case has been reported so far. \"Generally aedes mosquito, which is a host of dengue viral, dies in extreme temperature but there are hundreds of construction works going on in the city. These areas are prone to water collection and this may lead to the birth of aedes mosquitoes,\" said Dr Anil Bansal, member, Delhi Medical Council."}

Hospitals are still seeing a high number of dengue cases, followed by upper respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract diseases.\"\nAccording to the MET department, the sudden change in weather was because of a low pressure area created in Lakshwadeep right up to the South Gujarat coast. The maximum and minimum temperatures in November are edging on extremes, between 35 degrees Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius. In addition to it, high levels of humidity \u2014 87% in Colaba and 69% in Santa Cruz \u2014 have been contributing towards unseasonal showers.\n\"A lot of people feel under the weather when season changes. We are getting a high number of people with throat infection and respiratory tract infection, apart from dengue,\" said Dr Pratit Samdhani, general physician, Jaslok Hospital.\nWhile doctors have warned against self-medication, they said any kind of fever shouldn't be taken lightly. \"Avoid taking aspirin/brufen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. People with co-morbid factors, like diabetes and hypertension, or those having chronic ailment, should be more careful,\" said Dr Subodh Kedia, physician practising in Kalanagar, Bandra.\nMeanwhile, BMC's health department has started its special dengue drive, where it is micro-mapping the areas seeing more dengue cases and is trying to find the breeding spots of the aedes mosquito. With the unseasonal rains, the department is requesting Mumbaikars to ensure water accumulation is avoided to stop breeding.\nSo far, dengue has claimed 13, including a 23-year-old resident doctor from KEM hospital.\n0\n\n XXXXXX  Daily News & Analysis"}

India and Thailand continue to be the most frequent countries of travel reported for dengue cases, although in 2013, there was also an increase in cases associated with travel to Barbados.\nThere was also an increase in chikungunya with 24 cases reported in 2013 compared to 15 cases in 2012, mostly acquired in India and South East Asia.\nIn December 2013, indigenously acquired chikungunya was first reported in St Martin, a French overseas territory in the Caribbean. By July 2014, at least 22 other islands and territories in the region had also reported indigenous chikungunya, this includes four cases reported in the UK associated with travel to the Caribbean.\nDr Jane Jones, travel and migrant health expert at PHE said: \u201cDengue fever and chikungunya are unpleasant viral illnesses that are transmitted by day-biting mosquitoes. As there is no specific preventive medicine or vaccination against dengue fever or chikungunya, prevention relies on\u00a0 avoiding mosquito bites \u00a0particularly around dusk and dawn when the day biting mosquitoes are most active.\nDr Vanessa Field, joint director at National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC) said: \u2018We strongly recommend travellers should seek pre-travel advice from their GP, a specialist travel clinic or pharmacy at least six to eight weeks before they travel. To minimise the risk of mosquito bites it is advisable to wear appropriate clothing to cover up \u2013 such as long sleeve tops and trousers, and to use insect repellents. If a traveller develops symptoms such as fever, rash or joint pain within two weeks of returning from a foreign trip, they should seek medical advice from their GP.\u201d\nDengue fever is a viral illness spread by day-biting\u00a0Aedes\u00a0mosquitoes. Symptoms include a severe flu-like illness, fever, headache, muscle ache, rash, nausea and vomiting. Dengue is common in parts of Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Central and South America and the Western Pacific.\nChikungunya fever is a viral illness with similar symptoms to dengue fever, although joint pains may be a more prominent feature. Most patients make a full recovery, but in some cases joint pain and arthritis may persist for several months, or even years. It occurs in parts of Asia and Africa but has more recently spread to the Caribbean region and to parts of South and Central America. It is not spread directly from person to person but is transmitted by the same mosquito species that also transmits dengue fever.\nNotes\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The annual data for\u00a0 Chikungunya data \u00a0and\u00a0 Dengue fever \u00a0are available\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More general information is available on\u00a0 Dengue Fever \u00a0and\u00a0 Chikungunya\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Travel health information available\u00a0 for each country \u00a0from the NaTHNaC website\n\u00a0\n\n XXXXXX  New Zealand Times"}

However, there was also a rise in the number of cases linked to holidays in Barbados last year.\nThe statistics highlight the importance of taking out medical travel insurance before travelling to Asia.\nSymptoms of dengue fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, include a high temperature that can reach up to 41C, headache, pain behind the eyes, bone, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting.\nDengue usually clears up by itself within one or two weeks, but a small number of people go on to develop a more serious form of the disease known as 'severe dengue', which can lead to bleeding and organ damage.\nPHE also reported a significant rise in the number of chikungunya fever cases - from 15 two years ago to 24 in 2013.\nSimilar to dengue fever, the condition is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and can cause fever and severe joint pain, which can last for months or even years in some cases. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and a rash.\nDr Jane Jones, travel and migrant health expert at PHE, described both dengue and chikungunya as \"unpleasant\" illnesses.\nShe added that no vaccine or other preventive medicine against the conditions exists, and the only way to avoid being infected is to try and avoid mosquito bites - particularly in the morning and evening, when the mosquitoes are at their most active.\n\u2022 http:/www.world-first.co.uk/home/travel-insurance/medical-problems.aspx (medical travel insurance)\n\n XXXXXX  World First Travel Insurance"}

If left untreated, severe malaria leads to almost certain death within 48 hours. In 2012, malaria killed an estimated 483,000 children under-five years of age. UNITAID\u2019s new investment in six high malaria burden countries is estimated to cut malaria case-fatality rates by more than 10%. \u00a0 In health facility settings, WHO recommends injectable artesunate for severe malaria. \u00a0Although this is the most effective treatment for severe malaria and it can be administered rapidly and with ease, availability and uptake has been low. \u00a0It is up to three times more expensive than traditionally used quinine. According to the UNITAID 2013 Medicines Market Landscape, less than 15% of the total volume of injectable artesunate needed to treat severe malaria was procured in 2012. This new UNITAID-supported project aims to increase access to injectable artesunate by promoting and supporting its use, helping new manufacturers to enter the market by attaining WHO approval and by preventing stock-outs and reducing product price by at least 20% by mid-2016. (Read: Are you at risk of suffering from malaria? ) \u00a0 In cases where a health facility is not within immediate reach of a severely sick child, WHO recommends the use of fast-acting pre-referral treatment with rectal artesunate. A community health worker or a mother can administer these suppositories, thereby buying time while the child is transported to a health facility for continued treatment. Access to this product is currently limited though: no WHO-approved rectal artesunate product is currently on the market. (Read: Now a new method to help treat malaria ) This UNITAID- supported market intervention is led by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) and implemented by CHAI and the Malaria Consortium initially focusing on six countreis: Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda. MMV and partners aim to improve market conditions and show the feasibility of switching to injectable artesunate as well as to support manufacturers to gain WHO approval and enter the market for both injectable and rectal artesunate products.

Rotavirus-related diarrhoea  ... XXXXXX  Vaccines can change children\u2019s future  &nbsp;&nbsp;\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; Comment  The Hib vaccine has been established as safe.  India must give the anti-Hib and anti-diarrhoeal vaccine a push.  A single medical discovery has changed the future of children. Vaccination is a powerful and cost-effective weapon against disabling and life-threatening diseases. In India, nearly two million children still die from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, malnutrition and birth complications.  Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a major cause of bacterial meningitis while pneumonia caused by Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae or pneumococcus) is also a threat to children&#8217;s health worldwide.  Rotavirus-related diarrhoea sends thousands of children to the hospital and kills a large number too. New vaccines are available to protect against these pathogens and India is now gradually moving towards including these latest vaccines in the immunisation programme.  In fact, 2011-20 has been declared the &#8216;Decade of Vaccines&#8217; by the global community. Awareness about the benefits of vaccines and advocacy for the introduction of new lifesaving vaccines must increase during this period. The health and well-being of millions of children will improve only when the importance of vaccines is acknowledged.  Vaccines provided under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) in India offer children protection from just a handful of infections &#8212; tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, polio, measles and Hepatitis B across the country and Japanese encephalitis in some areas.  New vaccines against Hib and rotavirus have gained popularity in many countries. The benefits of these vaccines are yet to be maximised in India.  The three new vaccines that will benefit children the most in the country are the pentavalent vaccine that confers protection against Hib; the rotavirus vaccine and the pneumococcus conjugate vaccine.  Other countries have readily embraced these vaccines, and are deriving their benefits. Hib vaccine has been a part of routine immunisation programmes in several countries after WHO&#8217;s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), recommended in 2006 that this be included in national immunisation programmes. Of the 194 WHO Member States, 185 have adopted the pentavalent vaccine that protects against Hib.  And the benefits have been huge, since Hib diseases have almost disappeared in these parts of the world.  India too would derive massive benefits: 72,000 child deaths and nearly three million hospitalisations in India will be prevented each year once the Hib programme is established across the country.  In India, the pentavalent vaccine that contains Hib (and also protects against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B) has been popular for a decade in the private sector, and was included in the National Immunisation Programme more recently.  The vaccine was introduced in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in 2011 after endorsement by India&#8217;s National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation and a detailed review of vaccine safety coordinated by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).  Since then, the pentavalent vaccine has also been introduced in six additional states.   PENTAVALENT safety  The introduction of the pentavalent vaccine in some Asian countries has been associated with safety concerns.  This included reports of deaths shortly after vaccination in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Vietnam.  Because of these concerns, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Vietnam temporarily suspended pentavalent vaccine use as a precautionary measure. In all countries, investigations by local governments, WHO and international experts have not demonstrated a causal link between vaccination and infant death.  As a result, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Vietnam have resumed the use of pentavalent vaccine.  Faith in the safety of this vaccine was further reinforced after WHO&#8217;s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed the pentavalent vaccine safety data from four countries (Sri Lanka, Bhutan, India and Vietnam) and concluded that it was safe.  The Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) has expressed concern about the misinformation being spread about the vaccine, and has denounced attempts to distort facts.  IAP maintains that pentavalent is safe and endorses the government&#8217;s decision to introduce the vaccine in six states.  While efforts should continue to ensure the safety of vaccines, the drive to introduce immunisation that reduces childhood illnesses and saves lives should not be compromised.  The WHO remains committed to working with the national government to enhance the benefits of safe and efficacious vaccines to India&#8217;s population.

Continuous efforts and dedication has made it come true. Not a single case of death due to malaria has been reported in the Lanjigarh block of the district in the past two years. Moreover, the cases of pediatric malaria have gone down by around 50% over the past few years.&nbsp;  Joint efforts by the district medical unit and Vedanta Aluminium at Lanjigarh have been able to script this success story. According to Dr. Sabita Swain, Chief Medical Officer, Vedanta Aluminium Limited, &ldquo;The medical unit from Vedanta Aluminum and the district medical team have been working relentlessly on spreading awareness about the ill-effects of mosquito biting and the benefits of keeping their surroundings clean. This has resulted in a sharp drop in cases of malaria amidst children and pregnant women.&rdquo;  According to experts, the block is a part of the malaria endemic zone and most adults here carry traces of malaria parasite in their blood. Thus, reduction in pediatric malaria cases is a critical indicator of a better future as it confirms that the future generation will not have to live with the parasite being a permanent feature in their blood stream.  \"Zero malaria death in the block is a great achievement. The awareness programmes taken up jointly by the health department and Vedanta Aluminium have been able to deliver good results,\" says Dr. Swapna Sarit, Block Medical Officer, Lanjigarh.  The malaria awareness campaign launched by Vedanta Aluminium has played a vital role in achieving the feat in the block, and it is well supported by the Vedanta Hospital at Lanjigarh. The hospital has an outreach of 50 kms across Kalahandi and Rayagada districts and provides state-of-art facilities to tribal and local communities of the region. Moreover, each family from the core villages has been provided health cards to maintain health history. Over 5000 such cards have been distributed so far in 34 villages.  With a vision to change the ground realities related to health issues in Kalahandi district, which is infamous for malnourishment, poverty, malaria deaths and poor medical infrastructure, the Vedanta Hospital aims at providing quality healthcare facility to all and educate people about the necessity of maintaining hygiene and sanitation. The hospital also conducts regular health surveys to obtain health history of every family in and around Lanjigarh which has been quite helpful in better treatment of people of the area. More than 129,000 patients have been treated at the hospital since December 2010.  : What was once considered as an uphill task has become a reality now.

As many as 478 students were shifted to local private hospitals. \"The condition of 50 to 60 students is serious and they are undergoing treatment,\" Medipally inspector Ravi Kiran Reddy said. According to him, a case was registered against the college management under sections 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code and section 47 of the Food Adultration Act. Meanwhile, panic-stricken parents, who came to know about the incident through the media, rushed to the hospitals and blamed the college management for not responding to their calls. Several students unions also staged dharnas on the college premises. Incidentally, the students are also slated to sit for their annual exam in less than a week. The police are now trying to determine which food item had caused the illness. \"As of now, we do not know which food item was stale. It is being investigated,\" police said.

Ram Mohan\nTweet\nNumber of cases reported has crossed 70 till date, much higher than that reported last year\nSpread of viral fevers, particularly dengue, is putting people under fear with many cases being reported from different parts of the district over the recent few days.\nBodhan town and many areas in its revenue division bore the brunt of the fevers this year. Two fresh cases of the dreaded viral fever were identified afresh at the health camps in the town on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the number of dengue cases reported crossed 70 as on date, which was much higher than that reported last year.\nA couple of casualties were also reported in the media, but except one case the authorities did not confirm them.\nThough the epidemic fevers broke out one and a half month ago and are continuing unabated, medical arrangements to combat them are not up to the mark. In the medical camps conducted in Bodhan as many as 13 patients tested positive for dengue and since they all belong to one area the residents are in a state of shock.\nWhile the department of medical and health is busy identifying the cases the Municipal Council has failed to keep the environs clean. Consequently, open drains are overflowing, turning breeding grounds for mosquitoes which are considered the main vector for the spread of the disease.\nWith lack of coordination between the two departments despite the patients being examined and treated the spread of the disease could not be brought under control. The medical and health department has chalked out an action plan to control the disease. Collection of blood samples, removal of stagnant water and arrangements to shift the patients to hospitals, depending on the seriousness, are the part of the plan.\nDistrict Medical and Health Officer Govind Waghmare expressed the hope that the disease would be brought under control within a week. All breeding grounds are being closed and special teams formed to identify them and create awareness among people to take preventive measures, he said.\nMedical teams were deployed in villages and instructions given to lower rung staff as regards the measures to be taken as part of the combat plan, he said, disclosing that all necessary medicines were kept available at Primary Health Centres.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

XXXXXX Dengue alarm in schoolboy death\nOUR BUREAU\nA 12-year-old boy from north Calcutta has died of dengue, allegedly after being treated for fever by a local physician\u0092s non-medical assistant during the first five days of his illness.\nClass V student Srijit Saha, who lived in Maniktala and studied at Bidhannagar Government School in Salt Lake, died on Monday night within hours of being admitted to the Institute of Child Health near Park Circus. He is officially the first victim of the mosquito-borne disease in Calcutta this season.\nThe weather over the past few weeks \u0097 mostly warm with short spells of rain \u0097 is ideal for the spread of the dengue-causing Aedes aegypti mosquito, virologists said.\nSrijit had been running a temperature since September 2 but apparently wasn\u0092t taken to a clinic until last Sunday, by which time his fever had subsided but his condition got worse. He had till then been on medication allegedly prescribed by the non-medical assistant, family sources said.\nThe first doctor who examined Srijit advised blood tests for malaria and typhoid, both of which were negative.\nOn Monday morning, the boy\u0092s parents took him to the Institute of Child Health. \u0093When Srijit was brought in around 10am on Monday, his pulse was very low and he was barely conscious. We were not finding his veins, so we administered fluids through the bone marrow. He was put on ventilation after an hour but was bleeding severely within the stomach. He died that night,\u0094 Apurba Ghosh, director of the institute, said.\nGhosh learnt that Srijit had shown telltale signs of dengue like abdominal pain and vomiting two days after his fever had subsided. His family apparently didn\u0092t recognise the symptoms.\n\u0093He wasn\u0092t taken to a doctor in spite of such serious symptoms because the fever had gone into remission,\u0094 Ghosh said.\nThe institute has officially intimated the health department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation about dengue being the cause of Srijit\u0092s death.\nSrijit\u0092s uncle Barun Saha \u0097 the boy\u0092s father Tarun Saha, who owns a garments stall near Khanna, was too distraught to speak \u0097 admitted that his nephew\u0092s treatment was delayed.\n\u0093We were late in admitting him to hospital. My brother first went to someone who works for a doctor but is not a medical professional. When we took him to a hospital on Monday, doctors said his condition was very critical. They told us his vital organs were not functioning,\u0094 Barun recalled.\nThe parents of several of Srijit\u0092s friends visited the family\u0092s house in a two-storey building on Muraripukur Road in Maniktala on Tuesday. \u0093We learnt from them that another student in the same class as my nephew has tested positive for dengue. I would request the authorities to check the school premises and destroy breeding grounds for mosquitoes, if there are any,\u0094 Barun said.\nThe tragedy of a 12-year-old boy losing his life because he didn\u0092t get proper medical treatment until it was too late highlights the perils of treating fever without medical supervision.\nAccording to guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on dengue, a person with the virus doesn\u0092t necessarily recover once the fever subsides. Symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding from the gums should never be ignored, the guidelines state.\nDengue at first triggers flu-like symptoms that last for two to seven days \u0097 high fever in the range of 104 degrees Fahrenheit, headache, pain in the eye sockets, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, joint, bone or muscle ache and rashes.\nSrijit had last attended school on September 4, two days after he started running a temperature. \u0093His family told us that he was running a temperature on Wednesday and that they had consulted a doctor after he returned home. When he attended classes on Thursday, he was on medication,\u0094 said Shakila Khatoon, the boy\u0092s maths teacher.\nAccording to his teachers, Srijit was an above-average student who loved art and football.\nSources in the CMC\u0092s health department said the standard operating procedure for a neighbourhood with incidence of dengue was to check approximately 50 houses surrounding the \u0093affected\u0094 residence. \u0093We have spoken to the neighbours of the family that lost a child. Fogging was carried out within a 100-metre radius of the boy\u0092s house.

Civic body's budget of more than Rs 10 lakh and fogging machines have failed to control mosquito breeding.\nSoon after the city recovered from jaundice scare, now mosquitoes ring alarm bell over malaria and dengue. Amid jammed sewer lines, scattered garbage and accumulated rainwater, RMC has proved to be a complete failure in controlling breeding of mosquitoes.\nCorporation's budget and numerous fogging machines couldn't help control problem mainly in low-lying and densely populated areas. Civic body has about 20 fogging machines and it is mandatory to spray anti-mosquito pesticide?B-larva-- in each ward of city, once a week.\nCitizens however complained although fogging was being done in VIP areas, those most affected and vulnerable are left out. \"Once a week fogging is a distant dream for residents of most residential colonies. Moreover, these days even fogging has been ineffective in VIP areas. Either mosquitoes have turned immune or the spray isn't effective anymore,\" Sahiljeet Singh, a resident of Katora Talab said.\nAccording to RMC health officer Shiv Sharma fogging wasn't being done due to rains as it renders the entire process ineffective during rains but it has already started in all wards.\nHe said RMC plans to buy more effective pesticide in future.\nChhattisgarh stands second in highest number of malaria cases in country and in absence of proper garbage management and cleanliness in city, it is always citizens who have to face the brunt. But officials in civic body also expect from citizens to take charge and co-operate in maintaining hygiene. Officials insisted on keeping the surroundings clean and remove accumulated water, cover garbage bins and volunteer to cover sewerage too. \"RMC is already in a dispute with Kiwar Environ, which has been given the contract for city's garbage management. They have been found lacking, hence we have urged for co-operation from citizens,\" a senior official said.\nThis year a death due to malaria has been reported from the city, while 43 people were claimed by the disease in state last year.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Speaking about the huge of dengue cases, he said, \"It looks like the virus has undergone a mutation and it is less potential this year due to strains having become weaker.

Those infected suffer muscle and joint pain, nausea, horrible headaches and eye pain, rash, bruising and mild bleeding (such as a nose bleed or bleeding of the gums).\nIn northeast Brazil, mosquitoes have been genetically altered so that their offspring will not survive, according to CCTV America.

This has come to light a day after a three-year-old boy died due to diarrhoea and 30 were admitted in hospitals.\nAdvertisement\nThe MC had allegedly supplied water without testing the water from the tubewell. Meanwhile, around 100 fresh cases were reported on Wednesday.\nAs per the norms, before supplying the water from tubewell to the supply lines, it is mandatory to test the existing water in the tubewell for nearly three hours as it can be contaminated due to stagnation.\nThe authorities should also collect samples and ensure that the water is fit for human consumption before supplying it. In the said case, neither the testing was done, nor the samples were collected.\n\u201cA new tubewell began supplying water recently and the officials concerned did not test it. Now after so many days, they collected the samples and found them fit for human consumption. This makes no sense now as the contaminated water has already been supplied,\u201d a public health department official told Hindustan Times.\n\u201cInstead of going for chlorinators as was done earlier for chlorination of tubewell water, the civic body has gone back to the old system. The water is now treated by using sodium hypocholride solution instead of chlorine that gives only 15% of the chlorine content and is more costlier than chlorine,\u201d said the official.\nMunicipal Corporation Commissioner Vivek Pratap Singh said, \u201cWe have asked the UT administration to conduct a probe into the issue.\u201d\n\u201cIt is sad. Despite complaining several times about it, the MC continues to play with the lives of the people residing in the colonies and villages.

The administration should initiate measures to register workers at the construction sites and to monitor their health condition. Ramachandra Bairy, District Health Officer of Udupi, said that steps have been taken to list the names of workers at construction sites in the district with details such as their phone numbers. AB Ibrahim, Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada district, asked the authorities of Mangalore City Corporation to prepare a list of construction sites and the people working there. Suresh Shetty, a person representing a non-governmental organisation, urged the health officials to take actions against the hospitals and clinical laboratories if they fail to report the cases of malaria to the Health Department.

Last year, during the same period as many as 150 cases were recorded. The district registered the highest number of dengue cases in April at 27 followed by 18 in May. This is the period when two deaths occurred.\nDistrict surveillance officer Rajesh BV said that if it does not rain in the next few days like it did a few days ago, there could be a spurt in dengue cases.\nThough most cases are reported from Mangalore urban and Mangalore rural areas, health officials fear that other areas are also seeing an increase in dengue cases. A few days ago some cases were reported from Belthangady taluk.\nSix cases were reported from Kanyadi and Aladangady and of them one person has been sent to Mangalore for better treatment. Dr Rajesh said though they tested positive after NS1 Spot test, the results are not confirmed by Elisa.\nThe NS1 antigen is a viral protein, which is detected in the early part of infection, while IgM-Elisa can detect dengue only five days after the onset. So in the spot test there are chances of false positives and negatives.\n\"If there is a break in rain, there will be fresh water stagnation which provides a healthy breeding ground for mosquitoes. With no source reduction, which is primarily the responsibility of individuals, domestic and peri-domestic breeding is rampant, especially in rural areas. Unless citizens take the responsibility for source reduction, it is difficult to control this diseases. Dengue is transmitted by several species of mosquito within the genus Aedes, principally A. aegypti. The district has reported 4,131 malaria cases and two deaths in the six months from January this year,\" he added.\nA decade ago, an awareness drive carried out following two dengue deaths saw a drastic reduction in the number of cases. So much so that between 2004 and 2006 there were only 11 cases and one death. The cases saw a rise in 2009 which was 422 with two deaths and thereafter the number of positive cases has been above the 100 mark.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Rajesh BV,malaria,District surveillance officer\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

There is a need to destroy sources of malaria breeding centres in Mangalore Airport as a few airport staff have been infected with malaria.\nFogging should be taken up in and around Airport. The authorities should convene a meeting of all the builders in the city limits and ask them to go for rapid diagnostic kits to test malaria on the spot.\nThe builders should be asked to destroy the source in the construction sites. Nets should be supplied to all the labourers and make sure that they use the nets during night to avoid mosquito bites. There is a need to create awareness among the people on the need to destroy sources of mosquito breeding centres.\nDr Shantharam Baliga said that there is a need for capacity building for the volunteers and fullproof data collection system. District Vector Borne Disease Control Officer Dr Arun Kumar said that tracing the labourers is a challenge for the authorities. Many a time, Malaria is tested negative for Rapid Diagnostic (RD) kit and positive for blood smear test.\nNo diagnosis of malaria is being taken up in Kadri, Jeppu and Bejau centres. Instead of closing the centre at 5 pm, it would be better to extend the timings.\nNine patients suffering from malaria had died in Dakshina Kannada district in\u00a0 2014. Mangalore City has recorded 886 cases of malaria in June taking the total number of cases to 3,766 in 2014.\nDakshina Kannada district has recorded 998 cases of malaria in June taking the total number of cases to 4,131 in 2014.\n\n XXXXXX  Deccan Herald"}

An official from the department also confirmed that the district had been consistently showing large number of cases over the years.\nOfficials of the department told Deccan Herald\u00a0 that special care had been taken to ensure that appropriate measures were taken in Ramanagara. However, they added that most measures fell flat with unhygienic conditions prevailing in the district.\n\u201cThere are awareness programmes that are conducted. However, the issue is that it is one of the primary areas where vegetables are cultivated. Waterlogging and leaking drainage is a common problem in the district,\u201d said the official. Further, in places like Doddipalya, chemical contamination is rampant.\nHe added, \u201cFrom what we have noticed, the conditions are so bad that people even fear buying the farm produce from this region as water from the drainage gets mixed with drinking water. This even stagnates in the fields making it conducive for mosquitoes to breed.\u201d\nDespite the State\u2019s dubious distinction of recording the highest number of deaths due to vector-borne diseases in the country in 2013, little has been done to tackle the situation.\nKarnataka reported 5,532 confirmed cases and at least 12 deaths in that year. Also, 21 deaths were reported in 2012.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDengue cases\nDengue cases and large-scale deaths have also been reported from Haveri, Shimoga and Mysore in the past. As many as 413 cases tested positive for dengue from January 14 to June 21 across the State, with 43 cases in Bangalore alone.\nThe highest number of dengue cases in 2014 was reported from Haveri at 61.\nApart from measures that have been taken by the authorities, the commissioner of public instruction has been asked to inform headmasters in schools about the measures that need to be taken. Also, each Taluk Panchayat will have a breeding checker to ensure hygienic conditions and keep a check on water stagnation.\n\u2018Dengue death in B\u2019lore not proved\u2019\nEven as five-year-old Sania, a resident of Adugodi, died at St John\u2019s Hospital allegedly due to dengue, director, Department of Health and Family Welfare said that it was not a case of dengue death. \u201cIt has not been proved,\u201d the director said. However, hospital authorities said that the girl, who suffered multiple organ failure following dengue, breathed her last at her residence.\u00a0\n\n XXXXXX  Deccan Herald"}

As many as 33 patients from these areas got treated at Mulky community health centre during the last one month, while several more were treated at Concetta Hospital Kinnigoly, Srinivasa Hospital Mukka, Padmavati Hospital Suratkal and Wenlock Hospital Mangalore. The community health centre has identified eight among them as dengue cases. \u00a0Around 28 more patients were treated at Concetta Hospital Kinnigoli during April from these areas, and out of them seven were admitted as inpatients.\u00a0 To add to the problems, 27 persons, most of them of north Indian origin, who are working for an under-construction residential complex, have suffered from malaria. Workers in an under-construction complex at Haleangady too are afflicted with malaria. \u00a0 The situation has taken turn for the worse this year, in spite of the town panchayat\u2019s claim of having taken extensive precautionary measures like clearance of tender coconut shells, repeated fogging, clearance of drains, distribution of pamphlets etc.\u00a0 Only one dengue case was reported from Mulky community health centre in 2009, while the figure rose to 3 in 2011, before coming down again to one last year. It may be recalled that several locals had demanded for laying the pipes supplying water separately, as they have been laid in the drains as of now.\u00a0 Dr Savita Bhavanishankar, administrative medical officer of Mulky community health centre, has advised people to use mosquito nets, maintain cleanliness around the house, and ensure that water does not stagnate. Vani Alva, chief officer of Mulky town panchayat, said that various measures like removal of silt from drains and home to home visits have been undertaken to regulate spread of these diseases. \n\n \n\n Stay updated wherever you go with Daijiworld.com and Daijiworld 24X7 tv channel mobile apps. \n\n CLICK HERE to download it for your device.\n\n(available on Android and IOS)"}

Dr Jagdish, research officer, Department of Health and Family Welfare, said the number of deaths in the year 2006 was 26, and in 2007, it was 18. Statistics also show that the number has been constantly decreasing ever since. The Dakshina Kannada district contributes about 40 per cent and Udupi 15 per cent of the total malaria cases in the State, Jagdish said. According to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), over 50,000 people in the country and more than a crore across the world die of mosquito-borne diseases each year. In a press release, D S Rawat, Secretary General, ASSOCHAM, stated that malaria morbidity and mortality were a matter of major public health concern as they hugely affected the social and economic conditions of the people and lead to poverty. As a part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR), it has planned to launch an awareness campaign with an aim to spread information about ma\u00a0 laria, its causes, prevention and treatment on the eve of World Malaria Day commemorated every year on April 25. Stating that groundwater in over 200 districts in India was not fit for drinking due to concentration of fluoride, iron, salinity and arsenic, which affect about two lakh habitatio\u00adns with 85 per cent of population dependent on gro\u00adu\u00ad\u00adnd\u00adwater, Rawat said, \u201cAbout 75 per cent of India\u2019s water supply was seriously polluted with sewage and industrial effluents, promoting water-borne diseases which affect over 70 million working days.\u201d With the year\u2019s theme being \u2018Invest in the future: Defeat malaria,\u2019 various organisations have also come forward to voice the need for financial support for the cause. The World Health Organisation has also urged various governments, development partners and the corporate sector to invest more to sustain these gains and eliminate malaria. Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia, said, \u201cWe must continue surveillance for malaria. Funding needs to be increased for diagnostics, drugs, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and research and response to drug and insecticide resistance. We need to empower communities to protect themselves.\u201d Also, with the sustained efforts of various State governments, India is expected to decrease malaria incidences by 50 to 75 by 2015, according to the WHO. \u201cAnother danger lies in the fact that the Anopheles mosquitoes, which carry malaria parasites, are increasingly becoming resistant to insecticides. There is a need to contain the emergence and spread of resistance of Anop\u00adhe\u00adles mosquitoes to insecticides. Moreover, reintroduction of transmission in areas free of malaria is always a threat if surveillance and rapid response are not sustained,\u201d a WHO note said. They also emphasised on the need for investments to develop new tools to conduct operational research to address bottlenecks in malaria control programmes and to scale up and ensure rational use of the existing interventions."}

Khader.  Govt. approved PBS test is not available with private doctors: Kakkilaya   With discrepancies creeping into malaria deaths figures, B.S. Kakkilaya, a physician who has worked in the field of malaria for decades, said there is a need to relook at the type of test carried out to detect malaria and not to dismiss the death as &#8220;not due to malaria&#8221;.   Dr. Kakkilaya said one of the reasons for the distortion in malaria death data in Dakshina Kannada was that only peripheral blood smear (PBS) test &#8212; the facility for which is available only with government hospitals &#8212; was acceptable for confirming malarial death.   A malaria death not confirmed through PBS is described as &#8220;suspected malaria&#8221; and the case is &#8220;brushed under the carpet&#8221;. Instead, he said, the death should be described as &#8220;unconfirmed&#8221;. The death should be explained as due to malaria and the test should be defined. Dismissing it as not due to malaria could skew the numbers.   &#8220;Since only PBS, and not Qualitative Buffy Coat (QBC), is accepted as proof of death due to malaria, and only District Government Wenlock Hospital, the District Surveillance Office and primary health centre (PHCs) have PBS test facilities, it follows that they alone have the conclusive test for malarial deaths,&#8221; he said.   In Mangalore, QBC is used more to test malaria, one of the reasons being it was introduced in the region 20 years ago and is now well-entrenched here, he said.   He said it would be best for the National Vector Control Disease Programme (NVCD) to issue a directive to define malarial deaths. &#8220;That&#8217;s the ideal,&#8221; he said. Other than PBS, the Qualitative Buffy Coat test is done to detect malaria. But QBC is not accepted as confirming death due to malaria.   H.S. Shivakumar, District Health Officer (DHO), said, &#8220;According to national guidelines, a smear test must be done. A PBS, that&#8217;s what we rely upon.&#8221;   While speaking to reporters on malaria deaths as reported by NGOs, here on Saturday M. Madan Gopal, Principal Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, said: &#8220;We will have to do a verbal autopsy (build the history of illness of the patient, along with interviews of family members and neighbours), which is a tested mean of figuring out if the patient has died primarily due to malaria or other complications.&#8221; He said &#8220;experiences&#8221; with other reported communicable-disease deaths such as chikungunya epidemics have shown that cause of deaths is not directly linked to a disease. \u00a0   Minister of Health and Family Welfare U.T. Khader said he had asked the Urban Development Department to assist the Health Department in its programmes. Health inspectors would handle the programme ward-wise and 60 sprayers would make house-to-house visits in the city. Labour unions, especially related to the migrant labour population, would be involved. Gram panchayats have been asked to conduct awareness programmes and distribute guppy fish to houses. &#8220;We will investigate why the discrepancies happened in DHO office,&#8221; he said.

While Harinakshi, 10 had succumbed to the disease on Tuesday, her brother Ajith, 8, died on Thursday. District surveillance officer Dr Rajesh B V had confirmed that these children had died due to malaria.   The DHO examined the areas in and around the house where the children resided. They even examined a rivulet that flows by close to the house. Later, the health officials interacted with the villagers and informed them on the steps that need to be taken to ensure that malaria does not spread. Villagers were asked to ensure that there is no stagnant source of water in the vicinity of their homes. A health check up camp was conducted for the children.   A team of CPI workers too visited the house of Taniyappa Mugera at Shishila village on Saturday on directions from physician B Srinivas Kakkilaya. Taniyappa informed the team that no one in the near vicinity of his house is suffering from malaria and that when his children were down with fever; they were immediately taken to the primary health centre in Belthangady and admitted there for treatment.   Noting that the blood samples were not tested at the PHC, Taniyappa said he subsequently shifted the children to District Government Wenlock Hospital for treatment. However, their subsequent deaths has come as a shock to the family, Taniyappa said adding that lack of proper medical advise at the PHC has resulted in this incident. The reports given at the PHC indicated hepatitis, Taniyappa informed the activists.   P Sanjeeva, secretary of the district unit of CPI said the immediate vicinity of Taniyappa's household is clean and chances of malaria originating from there are remote. Blaming the doctors at the PHC for their negligence, Sanjeeva said the move to collect fee to test their blood, although the family is covered with a BPL card is inhuman. Demanding a thorough probe, the party sought maximum compensation to the family of the deceased.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Mangalore   10-yr-old succumbs to malaria, authorities claim first death In 3 yrs, Doctors refute it  The writer has posted comments on this article   Stanley Pinto   READ MORE  MANGALORE: Dakshina Kannada, which is known to be endemic to malaria, had forgotten about malarial deaths as there were no fatalities in the past three years.   However, on Tuesday, a 10-year old girl hailing from Belthangady taluk became the first victim of this vector- borne disease this year.   Harinakshi is the daughter of Taniya Mugera and Baby from Shishila village. District surveillance officer Dr Rajesh BV confirmed the death.   \"The victim was affected by plasmodium falciparum (Pf),'' he said. Her brother, Ajith, 8, has been affected with both strains of malaria- Pf and plasmodium vivax (Pv).   Regarding malarial cases in the area, Dr Rajesh said they took 39 smears for both Pf and Pv and they were all negative. We are investigating how she got it. The children don't have a history of travelling. Harinakshi went to Mangalore on December 31 and returned the same night. We doubt she caught it there since the incubation period of malaria is 15 days. She was admitted to the hospital with jaundice on January 2 and died on Tuesday due to malaria-associated complications,'' he said.   According to statistics available on communicable diseases with the district surveillance unit, one malarial death each happened in 2009 and 2010. From 2011 to 2013 there were no fatalities.   However, physician   Dr BV Kakkilaya   does not buy this. \"This is not the first death in many years. If the authorities claim so, it is wrong. In that case, even deaths proven with all relevant confirmatory materials are not listed by the city corporation. If people from rural areas have started dying of malaria, that too in January, it means that there is intense transmission of falciparum malaria in rural areas, which was almost unknown all these years,' he said.   Pointing out that the death means the official figures of malaria are far too lower than the actual incidences, he said this tragic death highlights the total failure of the district malaria officer   in controlling the spread of the vector-borne disease in DK.   He also urged health and family welfare minister UT Khader to wake up to the situation.   Dr Kakkilaya said in urban areas particularly in construction sites, mosquito breeding must be controlled by source reduction steps, and in rural areas, mosquito transmission must be controlled by indoor spraying.   Active and passive surveillance must be strengthened. This is totally neglected by authorities. The officials are in denial about the very high prevalence of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases including dengue. One Siddappa was died of malaria on October 14, 2012. It was promptly reported with all relevant slides to the malaria officer. But, it does not reflect in the figures of 2012,'' he said casting doubts on the statistics.   Official speaks : District malaria officer Dr Arun Kumar said there may be some cases where the person may have died of other causes and had malaria too. I will get in touch with the doctor and get details,'' he added.

XXXXXX  Dengue arrives ahead of monsoon; mosquito larvae found all over city\nVandana Singh , Hindustan Times \u00a0Ludhiana, June 17, 2014\nFirst Published: 10:43 IST(17/6/2014) | Last Updated: 10:55 IST(17/6/2014)\nComments\nEight cases of dengue fever have already been reported in the city, much before the onset of the monsoon. In an alarming development, health officials have found larvae of the aedes egypti mosquito, the main vector that transmits the virus that causes dengue, breeding in houses located in over a dozen places across the district. Last year, over a 1,000 dengue cases were reported in Ludhiana. As many as seven patients had died.\nAmong the localities where the aedes larvae were found are Haibowal Kalan, BRS Nagar, Shimplapuri, Guru Nanak Pura, Sunet, Kar nail Singh Nagar, Field Ganj, Chet Singh Nagar and Shahi Mohalla.\nThe health department says it discovered these larvae breeding spots only this month though it began conducting routine checks in all city areas in April. However, this claim is to be taken with a pinch of salt as the incidence of dengue had begun surfacing as early as April and May.\nDistrict epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said the aedes larvae found in houses were breeding in water coolers, flower pots or in water that had accumulated nearby. \u201cHowever, the larvae t hat were found could have been there since last year, as they often become dormant in winter and become active when coolers, flower pots, etc, are filled with water\u201d, he added.\nDespite claims to the contrary, health officials have not conducted any major inspections for larvae-breeding spots in the city with large buildings like hospitals and government remaining untouched till now. Last year water coolers at major hospitals were found to be breeding grounds for larvae of the dengue mosquito.\n\u00a0\u201cWe have began conducting checks for breeding spots in all city areas from April onwards, though we found the larvae only this month at several places. Our teams destroyed the larvae and also notified the municipal corporation, which has the authority to fine offenders. We will launch a major inspection drive next month when the dengue mosquito breeding season begins in earnest,\u201d said district epidemiologist Anil Verma.\n\n XXXXXX  Hindustan Times"}

So far, five patients have been confirmed. Out of them, three are from outside Ludhiana.\nOn Sunday, 25-year-old male patient was found suffering from dengue at DMCH.\nDistrict epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said, \u201cIn summers, residents start using desert coolers in which they normally use the previous year\u2019s cooling pads. These should be changed in every season because they may be carrying eggs of anopheles aedes, the mosquito causing dengue, which can become larvae whenever it will come in direct contact of fresh water being run in desert coolers. The eggs already laid in the cooler pads are bound to become larvae and spread dengue fever.\u201d\nDr Verma said they had appealed to the residents to clean the desert coolers thoroughly and change the pads so as to avoid the spread of the fever.\nAsked how mosquitoes could survive at such a high temperature when the conducive temperature for this insect is between 25-30 degrees Celsius, he said, \u201cInside the cooler, the minimum temperature is between 25-30 degrees Celsius only and hence it suits the mosquitoes to multiply faster.\u201d\nHe asked the residents to follow basic precautions as apart from dengue, they should also watch out for malaria as June was also being observed as the malaria month. One should not allow collection of water near houses and\u00a0 should keep water tanks properly covered.

India saw 870,000 malaria infections in 2013 and this number could go to between 435,000 and 220,000 in 2015. India and Thailand are on track to achieve a 50-75% decrease in malaria cases by 2015, according to the World Malaria Report 2014 released on Tuesday. The report also highlighted India\u2019s dependence on the oral drug artemisinin to treat malaria. The use of such single-drug therapies threatens the long-term efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), a key intervention to treat malaria, as it increases resistance to the drug. The number of countries that allow marketing of oral artemisinin-based single-drug treatments has declined rapidly across the world. As of November, only eight countries allowed the marketing of such treatment. The report said that 24 pharmaceutical companies, mostly in India, continue to market such drugs. WHO recommends that oral artemisinin-based treatments be withdrawn from the market and that marketing of these therapies should cease. Artemisinin resistance is a major obstacle in the fight against malaria, as it leads to persistence or recurrence of malaria parasites after appropriate drug treatment. Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in five countries including Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, but data on malaria transmission is insufficient. WHO had earlier warned that with the continuously increasing levels of population movement in Asia and the Pacific, the geographic scope of the problem could expand quickly. In 2013, 392 million courses of ACT were procured, up from 11 million in 2005. On the positive side, India also dominated in the number of microscopic examinations performed to diagnose malaria\u2014it performed 120 million slide examinations out of the global total of 197 million. Increased testing of suspected malaria cases is due in part to a higher number of patients tested by microscopy, both in the WHO African Region and globally. \u201cWe can win the fight against malaria,\u201d said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. \u201cWe have the right tools and our defences are working. But we still need to get those tools to a lot more people if we are to make these gains sustainable.\u201d The number of confirmed malaria cases reported in the Southeast Asia region decreased from 2.9 million to 1.5 million between 2000 and 2013. Three countries accounted for 96% of cases in 2013: India (58%), Myanmar (22%) and Indonesia (16%). An estimated population of 3.2 billion is at risk of mosquito-borne malaria which is entirely preventable and treatable. The malaria mortality rate has fallen by 47% worldwide, and by 54% in Africa between 2000 and 2013, according to the report. WHO highlighted the threat to malaria treatment and interventions in the Ebola endemic countries, especially Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia where most of the inpatient facilities are now closed. \u201cThe next few years are going to be critical to show that we can maintain momentum and build on the gains,\u201d said Pedro L. Alonso, director of WHO\u2019s Global Malaria Programme, who added that with sufficient funding and commitment, huge strides can still be made. \u201cThere are biological and technical challenges, but we are working with partners to be proactive in developing the right responses to these. There is a strong pipeline of innovative new products that will soon transform malaria control and elimination. We can go a lot further,\u201d Alonso said."}

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Kanpur   Doctors advise precautions as cases of brain stroke increase  The writer has posted comments on this article   RELATED   KANPUR: Amidst the fortnight long onslaught of intense cold wave, the city has witnessed a spurt in cases of brain (cold) stroke and cold diarrhoea. Alarmed at the situation, doctors have advised people to keep their ears and feet covered to keep sickness at bay. According to the OPD records of government hospitals, nearly 30% of the patient reporting in neuro (brain) and medicine departments display symptoms of brain (cold) stoke and cold diarrhoea. The doctors said that majority of the patients belonged to the young generation who often avoided precautions against cold. Winter accounts for nearly 40% brain stroke deaths in the city every year. According to doctors, nearly 70% of the stroke patients do not consult doctors during cold weather. Besides, 50% of them were unable to realize that the problem was related to stroke. Hence, at least 40% die without any treatment due to cold hemorrhage. The disease not only cripples normal functioning of the brain but also paralyses the body, making it difficult to carry out normal activity. \"Brain stroke also referred to as acute brain damage is caused by many reasons. The prime causes are blockage in blood vessels, transfer of blood clot in veins and arteries to any part of brain, rupture of blood vessels and deposition of fat in blood vessels (atherosclerosis),\" said Dr Richa Giri from medicine department of Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital .   and brain stroke could prove fatal during extreme cold conditions as being experienced in the city for the past week. The expert also said that the cold diarrhoea mainly affects children and infants. The brain stroke in winters mainly affects the younger lot who were careless about their health. Talking about the proper diet to be taken to avoid getting sick, Dr Anil Gupta, another physician said that the intake of adequate quantity of fluids (water and minerals) should be ensured. As far as possible, the young children and infants should be kept indoors in warm clothes to avoid exposure to cold conditions. The people were also advised to ensure that their ears and feet were always covered. \"The brain (cold) stroke results from inadequate and interrupted blood supply to the brain and is compounded by intense cold conditions. It is difficult to identify the initial symptoms of brain stroke, keeping a tab on blood pressure to keep it around normal level (120/80) is an effective way to avoid brain stroke in such conditions,\" added Dr Gupta further. Doctors added that the treatment within six hours of a stroke could reduce related conditions like disability, loss of memory or speech, and loss of vision and improve the patient's quality of life by 30%. The doctors also advised people to consult a specialist if symptoms of stroke like sudden severe headache, loss of vision in one or both eyes, numbness or weakness in one side of face or limbs and sudden confusion or trouble speaking was encountered.

The number of those suffering from diarrhoea was 253. None of the patients were serious,\" said Dr Sahebrao Gawle of Niphad sub-civil hospital.\nHealth officials have sounded an alert and medical teams have been rushed to the village to identify and treat those affected by the disease.\nThe officials said that though an outbreak had been declared locally, the final confirmation of the same would be done only after the DHO receives reports of stool samples sent to Pune.\nOfficials are still trying to identify the cause, but primarily, this seems to be linked to the very old water supply line in Niphad that might have been punctured at more than one site, resulting in contaminated water.\n\"We are trying to ascertain the cause of the disease. We believe the old water supply pipeline is at the root of the cause and the water supply department has been asked to set things right,\" Wakchaure said.\nThe district office had earlier designated the Niphad gram panchayat with a 'yellow card', considering the quality of water supplied in the village.\n\"We had sounded a caution on the quality of water supplied to the village. There is open defecation here and an open drainage system. Waterlogging has also %been reported from a number of places here, all leading to increased chances of water contamination,\" the official said.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sahebrao Gawle,Nashik,district health officer\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Maharashtra government to find out - Daily News & Analysis A BMC worker carrying out fogging operation in Mumbai The BJP-Shiv Sena-led state government has ordered an inquiry into use of ineffective chemical by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation during its fogging drive to kill mosquitoes. Congress and NCP have alleged that the use of ineffective chemical \u2013 Pyrethrum extract \u2013 eventually led to 67 deaths in the city alone. Besides BMC, a few other corporations too used the said chemical. Over 1.77 lakh people have been affected by dengue in Maharashtra in last nine months. The mosquito-borne tropical disease has claimed 164 lives in the state including 67 in Mumbai. Raising the issue in state legislative assembly, NCP's Bhaskar Jadhav said, \"In the laboratory tests it has been revealed that the chemical used to kill mosquitoes by fogging was ineffective. It could not kill even 80% of the mosquitoes. The BMC has bought the chemical from Kolkata- based Neeta Paul firm, which has been blacklisted by the Surat Municipal Corporation. \"The state agriculture commissioner had also issued a circular that mosquito killing and fogging chemicals should be bought from state-based firms only. Despite that, the BMC bought an ineffective chemical in gross violations,\" Jadhav alleged. The Congress and NCP alleged that not only BMC officials, but standing committee members were also hand in glove with the said company and demanded that they should be booked under IPC 302 (punishment for murder). Jitendra Awhad, another NCP leader said, \"The civic administration forwards a proposal, but it is always approved by the standing committee members. The standing committee which approves the proposals is also equally responsible for this gruesome crime.\" Congress legislator Amin Patel too said no one should be spared. \"These officials and elected representatives have played with the lives of the people and therefore should be punished,\" Patel said.

Are there plans to set-up specialized departments in suburban hospitals too?\nWe are getting patients not only from suburban hospitals but also from government hospitals across the state. Over 48 per cent patients treated in BMC hospitals are not from the city, 52 per cent come from outside the city, some even from different parts of the country. Patients do visit suburban hospitals, but on several occasions, while services are there, doctor\u2019s availability is an issue. Now we are planning to start diploma courses in gynaecology and ophthalmology to accommodate shortage of doctors. We will also increase retirement age of doctors to 65 years to retain them longer.\nTANUSHREE VENKATRAMAN: A High Court order has asked BMC to evacuate even C2 category buildings that are prone to collapses. Is BMC taking any step in that direction?\nIt is very difficult to vacate the premises. Residents are not happy with the alternate accommodation they are given. We have given residents in writing that after the building is reconstructed, they will be shifted back. But residents are not ready.\nMIHIKA BASU: In the past few months, civic hospitals themselves have become home to mosquitoes, with doctors falling ill. What steps are being taken?\nThis time it happened in hostels of resident doctors. Dengue mosquitoes breed in houses. We inspect at least 500 surrounding houses from where a dengue patient is found. In 85 per cent cases, dengue mosquitoes\u2019 larvae was found in houses of patients. Personal hygiene has to be taken care of. Mosquito larvae can stay intact for atleast\none year.\nTABASSUM BARNAGARWALA: The civic body has successfully brought down the number of malaria cases. What is it that we are doing wrong with dengue?\nWith malaria, our fogging activities were going in the right direction, whereas in the case of dengue, we cannot come to your house and inspect. Dengue larvae grows in clean water, we have found it in feng shui plants, in petri dishes below the flower pots, defrost trays and\nother spots.\nANJALI LUKOSE: Is the administration playing down the number of dengue cases? Every year the numbers brought out by Praja and MCGM differ.\nThe government of India recognises only confirmed dengue cases. We have been saying that dengue suspect cases have gone up to 9,000, but confirmed dengue cases are only 850. The number of deaths, according to our records are 12 and two are suspected deaths. Unfortunately, in most of the cases, the patients went to the hospitals after a gap of four to five days. We have been advocating that even if people have slight fever, they should not opt for self-medication, but visit a qualified doctor. Medicines like aspirin and Combiflam, which are taken normally, are very dangerous for dengue.\nMANASI PHADKE: Is there a way in which public-private partnership model (PPP) can be roped in to expand health services in continued\u2026\nWe are working on a massive plan to computerise the department.

According to experts, while the dengue virus is rarely known to attack the spinal cord and handful of cases have been reported in medical literature. The person who owns a computer shop in South Mumbai, was admitted with fever and platelet count of 70,000 (normal range 1.5 lakh to 4 lakh). What were the effects on the patient? Dr Pratit Samdhani, physician at Jaslok Hospital said: \"He is admitted 15 days back for dengue. On the second day of admission, he had acute urine retention. We then went for series of tests to find out the cause.\" The MRI scan of the spine and lumbar puncture showed inflammation in neck and cervical spine. \"It was clear that the dengue infection had affected his spinal cord. In medical terminology- Acute transverse myelitis is a rare manifestation of dengue but in his case it was rarest of rare as he had multiple areas in spine that got affected,\" said Dr Samdhani. What does medical literature say? Medical literature said that the mechanism of viral transmission and the extent of neuronal injury induced by dengue virus can occur in either the early (periinfectious) or late (post-infectious) phases of dengue fever. \"The early detection holds the key to speedy recovery. For six days he was on catheter as we continued with steroids and other treatment. Luckily he recovered well and was discharged late last week,\" said Dr Samdhani. Seeing the uniqueness of the case, the doctor will be sending this case to medical journal. Are dengue cases still rising? According to BMC health officials and city doctors, the number of dengue cases have started coming down with the dip in temperature. In November, 146 cases of dengue was registered which December first week saw only 17 dengue positive cases. Mumbai city and suburban districts, which fall under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has recorded the largest number of dengue cases and deaths this year. So far 19 dengue deaths have been registered in Mumbai this year with more than 700 dengue positive cases. Why were dengue cases high this year? According to health experts the number of cases reported in this time of the year seems to be higher than the corresponding period last year and that is also because of intermittent rainfall and temperature fluctuation. While National Institute of Virology-Pune report on dengue cases in Mumbai confirmed that two dengue viruses are presently in circulation, doctors say that the symptoms exhibited by maximum dengue patients resembles between type DEN-2 and DEN-4."}

XXXXXX Comments\nHow many people have died of dengue and malaria this year? The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) reportedly has two sets of figures for deaths caused by the diseases.\nData accessed recently from the BMC under the Right to Information (RTI) Act says that the two diseases killed 164 people between January and October this year. But the civic body\u2019s epidemiology cell records show that only 12 people died of dengue infection, while 16 died of malaria up to November this year.\nExperts said the discrepancy in recording deaths and the under-reporting of these communicable diseases has inadvertently affected the implementation of control measures. RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI application, said the data clearly indicates there is under-reporting of deaths by the civic body. HT has reported 19 cases this year of deaths caused by dengue infection in city hospitals. The figures for malaria deaths at private hospitals were not available.\nThe BMC explained the discrepancy in the figures with the logic that data accessed under the RTI is obtained on the basis of the cause of death mentioned in the death certificates issued by the treating physician. \u201cSometimes, the patient may have died of another condition, but just because he was positive for malaria infection at death, the cause is mentioned as malaria, which is not appropriate,\u201d said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC.\nDr Keskar added the civic epidemiology cell will count only those deaths that are confirmed by the expert committee, which reviews each suspected dengue or malaria infection death. \u201cSometimes, adequate tests are not conducted to confirm the diagnosis of malaria and dengue,\u201d said Dr Keskar.\nHowever, non-profit groups working in the field of public health have contested the civic body\u2019s argument that the causes recorded in death certificates are not a reliable basis for data.\n\u201cThe death certificates are issued under the Registration of Birth and Death Act and assume legal significance. If the civic body feels a particular cause is not reliable, it should be corrected and the appropriate cause should be mentioned instead,\u201d said Milind Mhaske, project director, Praja Foundation.\nThe RTI data showed more men died of malaria in comparison to women in the city.\nTill October this year, 65 men had died of malaria compared to 27 women.

In another screening test conducted by the primary health centres in Thrissur, a few cases of malaria have also come to the fore,\u201d said Abhilash Babu, project manager, Hope foundation, migrant project, Thrissur.\nChances are high to find more such cases in other districts, especially Ernakulam, where migrant labourers are aplenty, he said.\nDennis said the Society supports inter-linking of health projects as launching independent and comprehensive projects for migrant labourers is a Herculean task.\n\u201cPrimarily, it is difficult to get staff who are proficient in Hindi to converse with the labourers who are mostly from Hindi-speaking states.\n\u201cThere are workers associated with other health projects who have already been interacting with migrant labourers. Hence when a screening for a particular disease takes place, we too intervene and get proper statistics on that disease, apart from HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STD),\u201d he said.\nThe KSACS aims to implement the projects at three levels - transit intervention, source intervention and destination intervention.\n\u201cAs the first two levels are beyond our control we focus on the third level - destination intervention,\u201d Dennis pointed out.\nApart from the five projects, the KSACS has 10 projects across the state for migrant workers. But they focus on HIV and STD.The official said the support of the respective local self-governments and district administrations will have to be roped in as the five projects are prone to limitations.\n\u201cThe number of migrant labourers is swelling at an alarming pace. According to statistics by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), there were 23 lakh migrant population in the state until two years ago.\n\u201cThis has now surged to almost 25 lakh. But the five projects could cover only around 37,000 migrant population,\u201d he said.\nBesides, it has many socio economic issues too. Labourers with criminal backgrounds and the presence of Bangladesh immigrants are a matter of concern. Above all, the political parties also woo them for votes,\u201d he said.\nHence local self-governments and the respective district administration would have to play a proactive role to curb the spread of deadly diseases among migrant labourers,\u201d he said.\n\n XXXXXX  The New Indian Express"}

The LDF government then had a perfect plan with a 10-point agenda that was to be implemented in three years.\nYet nothing really worked out.\nA campaign for keeping our cities clean is not an idea should not become a ritual. The campaign should be able to conclude successfully, in a given time-frame, by putting in place a sustainable solution. A recent study on Kerala's garbage menace by R Ajayakumar Varma, former executive director of Suchitwa Mission, estimates the per capita generation of municipal solid waste in the state as 242 grams. The issue is more serious in cities and as per a 2007 study by Water Sanitation Programme South East Asia, per capita solid waste generation in the cities in Kerala is 400 gram per day.\nSuchitwa Mission executive director K Vasuki says that the programme is unlikely to be successful anywhere else if it fails in Kerala. Without public involvement this will never be a success.''\nA sustainable solution to the garbage issue is what each and every citizen of Kerala is hoping for. The failures of Vilappilsala, Njeliyamparambu, Kureepuzha and Brahmapuram have forced us to practice source-level segregation and decentralised waste processing. Even though the Suchitwa Mission has come forward with the plan to set up a new plant which converts waste to energy at Brahmapuram they could not successfully establish the feasibility of such a plant.\nWhat we need is fine-tuning these habits and finding scientific solutions to process solid waste generated in public places. The issue calls for an urgent solution too as dengue, leptospirosis and scrub typhus cases are on the increase in our cities. Heaps of garbage lined along our main roads and unscientific burning of non-segregated waste in the public has besides creating health problems is an eye sore for the tourists visiting the God's own country.\nThe campaign this time round is unique in many ways. Though not trumpeted, there is an interesting consensus among political parties for ensuring cleanliness. Narendra Modi is leading with Swachch Bharath campaign while the CPM practices Clean Kerala drive. Congressmen are also not far behind as demonstrated by Shashi Tharoor MP who led cleaning at Vizhinjam beach last week.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Suchitwa Mission,state government,Shashi Tharoor MP,Shashi Tharoor,Narendra Modi\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

The best way to prevent vector-borne diseases like malaria, they say, is to prevent the mosquitoes from breeding by avoiding creation of a puddle or a water-logged area etc.  Director of Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Parasitology and a researcher himself, Prof Md Masood Khan of department of Zoology, University College of Science, Osmania University, admits greater awareness among the people as one of the reasons. But, according to him, the major reason for decline in malaria cases this year could be the excessive rainfall the city received this season.  He, citing his research study on entomology, says, \u2018\u2019one of the reasons could be the heavy downpour which did not give room for stagnant water logging and washed away a majority of vectors.\u201d Another reason, according to him, was \u2018\u2019severe environmental changes that could have led to mutation of the vector. This may prove lethal for the vector and could risk their survival.\u201d He said, sometimes such changes prove to be a blessing in disguise.  Assistant meteorologist M Narasimha Rao of the Hyderabad Meteorology Centre too admitted that the city in 2013 received an excessive annual rainfall.  Echoing similar views with Prof Khan, though not completely, Dr Sunitha Nareddy, consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Hospitals, says that extreme weather could certainly be a factor in the decline of malaria cases. However, she pointed out that diseases like malaria and dengue usually carries a cycle, meaning once in every 3 or 4 years, there could be a sudden spurt.  Compared to 151 cases reported between March and May in 2012, around 119 cases were reported in 2013 at the Fever Hospital. Whereas, in the post monsoon period between September and November in 2012, 342 cases were reported at the Fever Hospital as against 163 cases reported in the same period in 2013.  &#039;Me and Ananth Kumar Have Learnt Our Lessons&#039; Public Grievance Redressal Cell in Delhi from Jan 11 Bone Up on Menace of Osteoporosis Zilli in The City The City of Childe Rolande More from this section Dancer&#039;s Rape: Mumbai Cops Coming Today to Help in Probe RCB Retains Kohli, Gayle, de Villiers  Your e-mail address   All comments will be reactively moderated   Disclaimer: The views expressed in comments published on are those of the comment writers alone.

Before that the students had consumed food prepared in the school.\nOn getting the information, Parents of the children rushed to the spot and brought the students to a 30-bedded government hospital in Vaiyampatti. However, the parents agitated after the alleged delay in treating the children due to lack of doctors.

Besides this, about 39,705 malaria patients were reported of which 40 died, and of the 1,673 gastro patients, five succumbed. Overall, 76,168 patients suffering from various diseases were identified of which 164 deaths were reported this year. The government, however, made it clear that there was no provision to pay compensation to the families of patients who died of dengue.\nThese disturbing figures were tabled before the Maharashtra Legislative Council by Public Health and Family Welfare minister Dr Dipak Sawant while replying to a call attention motion moved by Sanjay Dutt, Ashok Jagtap, Shobhatai Fadnavis, Niranjan Daokhare, Vidya Chavan and others. Claiming over 200 people died of dengue, they were keen to know efforts taken by the government to check the diseases. They blamed the government for failing to control the disease from becoming an epidemic. Levelling corruption charges on the health department officials, they alleged that large scale irregularities were reported in distribution of medicines and printing of posters.\nDutt was keen to know whether any polio-like vaccine was available for tackling dengue. He pointed out that research was underway in France where scientists were believed to have found out a cure.\nDenying allegations, Dr Sawant said the government was making all efforts to control the spread of all deadly diseases at all places where deaths were reported. \"There were apprehensions that the virus was mutated due to global warming, but thankfully, it was not. The research by the French government is still not complete and their reports were awaited.\"\nNegating allegations on posters, the minister added the government had printed about two lakh copies with an expenditure of Rs36 lakh. \"Those were printed to create awareness among citizens. Despite advice, they tend to collect water or pots for Feng Shui and other plants and keep them inside homes that offer good breeding ground for the dengue mosquitoes. Now, the disease is found more among middle and upper middle class instead of lower strata of society. Earlier, dengue was not reported among infants, but now, even those cases came to fore probably due to virus mutation.\"\nSpeaking about steps taken to control the disease, the Sena MLC said, in Mumbai, the civic body deployed seven vans carrying fog machines while similar efforts were also initiated in other cities. \"In slum areas, where the water is usually stored in plastic drums, Tamifos has been sprayed to stop the mosquito breeding. Strict actions are been taken against residents and households who are littering garbage. Moreover, quality generic medicines certified by WHO are being provided to patients,\" he added.\nKILLER NUMBER ONE\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

The official page of the CMO was updated with Fadnavis\u2019s picture on November 29, nearly a month after he took over as CM The delay, uncharacteristic of the BJP government\u2019s policy to utilise social media to full effect, is because the person entrusted with the password for the page is struck with both malaria and dengue. The page (www.facebook.com/CMOMaharashtra) was updated and previous CM Prithviraj Chavan\u2019s picture was removed, and replaced with the picture of Mantralaya on October 19 when the assembly poll results were declared. Fadnavis\u2019s picture showed up on November 29, when an official updated the page. The page was earlier being looked after by the IT department. On Monday, the in-charge of the page handed over the password and other settings to the CMO when he was discharged from hospital. The latter will soon begin posting updates on the page that currently lies dormant. Fadnavis is already active on Twitter. While the Facebook page is verified meaning accorded official status by Facebook the Twitter account is not. Fadnavis, following PM Narendra Modi, has an officer on special duty (OSD) to only look after social media and his YouTube channel. The CMO wants to share content on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, and be active in the virtual world. When asked about the issue, Rajesh Agarwal, the IT secretary of Maharashtra government, said he wasn\u2019t aware of it, and blamed the transition in government for the delay. \u201cIt seems the CMO wanted the same Twitter and Facebook name, and hence, there was a delay on part of Facebook.\u201d But sources in Mantralaya claimed it is the same page that was being used earlier by the previous CM, and there is no change in name. \u201cWe wanted to retain the same page, because it is properly maintained and is on the lines of the Facebook page of White House, especially with the history of all ex-chief ministers available on the page. Hence, we waited for the person to return and hand over control of the page to us,\u201d said the source."}

Of the 27 suspects who took the test, 11 - nine form city and two from rural -tested positive for dengue.\nOctober saw the maximum number of dengue patients. The figures available with the NMC's health and medical department reveal that from January 1 till date, as many as 527 samples have sent for testing. Out of these, 236 tested positive - 177 cases came from the NMC limits, while the remaining were from the outskirts of the city. In October alone, 218 samples were tested of which 100 were detected positive - 75 from the city and 25 from outskirts.\nMedical superintendent of the NMC B R Gaikwad said, \"Change in season and warm weather are favourable conditions for the dengue mosquitoes to breed.\" Virus Aedes aegypti that is transmitted through mosquitoes is known to breed better in such climatic conditions.\n\"We are carrying out preventive measures like fogging, along with awareness campaigns across the city to educate people. Our hospitals are well-equipped to treat dengue,\" Gaikwad added.\nHealth officials have reiterated that private medical practitioners should inform the civic body of dengue deaths.\n\"We have distributed circulars to medical practitioners about informing the civic body about dengue deaths. We have also written them letters.

The figure was 68 during 2013 while 403 cases were reported in 2012. Corporation officials attributed the drop to their proactive steps to curb the outbreak of dengue, especially with the city receiving considerably higher rainfall this monsoon.\n\u201cAt the first reported instance of dengue, we undertake measures such as fogging the areas. Clearing out stagnant water and introducing mosquito fishes into nearby waterbodies, if any, are a few of the other measures,\u201d an official said.\nThey also said that the Nochi plant scheme has worked out positively as far as vector control measures of the Corporation were concerned. Regarding malaria, 2,033 cases have been reported so far. The number was double that at 4091, a year earlier, while it stood at 4,258 in 2012.\nOfficials said that the main reason behind the halving of number of malaria cases was due to the monitoring of problem zones from the past. \u201cZones four, five, nine and 13 are the main problem areas for malaria. Most number of cases are reported in these zones and also there are natural breeding grounds for anopheles mosquito types,\u201d an official said.\nSignificantly, despite the water stagnation in many localities after this year\u2019s monsoon spell, figures from the Corporation suggest low number of rat fever or leptospirosis cases. With 84 cases reported so far, the number is far lesser than 229 recorded in 2013. In 2012, the number of leptospirosis cases stood at 351 thereby suggesting a positive decline in the last couple of years.\nOnly eight cases of chikungunya were reported this year, while in 2013 and 2012, nine and 12 cases respectively were recorded.\n\n XXXXXX  The New Indian Express"}

This, public health experts say, is because many private hospitals rarely inform the corporation of such cases. \n\n\n\n The most number of malaria cases (1,084) were reported from Royapuram zone in congested north Chennai followed by Teynampet (864) and Adyar (655). Adyar, through which the Adyar river and the Buckingham canal flow, recorded the most cases of dengue (44), followed by Kodambakkam (27) and Alandur (15). Manali (3), Madhavaram (8) and Alandur (9) reported the least number of malaria cases, while Sholinganallur (0), Thiruvottiyur (1) and Royapuram (1) recorded the least dengue cases. \n\n\n\n Dr Jayachandran, a general physician who has been practisingin Royapuram for more than 40 years, said an average of 10 patients visited him daily with symptoms of malaria in 2013. The corporation says it has intensified fogging operations, but entomologists and public health experts say dengue-causing aedes and malaria-causing anopheles still thrive. \n\n\n\n In Adyar, Federation of Residents Associations president P K Gunseelan said the corporation's fogging measures were not effective, but also blamed the residents for not keeping their surroundings clean. \n\n\n\n Former director of public health Dr S Elango said a recent survey had found a gradual increase in the aedes population. \n\n\n\n Chief minister J Jayalalithaa on Tuesday allocated 2crore for anti-mosquito measures, including appointment of health staff and procurement of larvicides. \"Mosquitoes are the reason for frequent disease outbreaks. The state is engaging field staff to identify sources of mosquito breeding areas and take up fogging and spraying insecticides,\" an official release said. There was no mention of allocation of funds for Chennai. Corporation officials said fogging was intensified and free mosquito nets were being distributed to families near water bodies. \n\n\n\n The prevention measures, experts say, are too few. The construction boom in the city draws thousands of migrant labourers crammed in unhygienic slums and near water bodies making them vulnerable to vector-borne diseases, they say. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Mosquitoes are no longer just a menace\u2014they are killers, going by the number of people contracting dengue, chikungunya, malaria and such vector-borne diseases. The city corporation has tried out several measures - from releasing guppies in water bodies to providing mosquito nets to residents - but the spread of the diseases shows no signs of slowing down. Civic authorities have either got their strategy wrong or are not implementing the vector-control measures they talk about. The health department of the corporation needs to be strengthened with resources and field workers should be held accountable to produce results in the form of reduced incidence of mosquitoborne diseases. Citizens should also keep their surroundings dry to avoid mosquito breeding."}

(Photo: DC/File)\nThiruvanthapuram:\u00a0With infectious diseases debilitating and killing people in hundreds in a state which not long ago boasted of health indicators comparable to the developed countries, questions are being raised about the callousness and misplaced priorities of the Health Department.\n\u00a0\nExperts say at a time when infectious diseases are killing people ruthlessly like terrorists, instead of deploying specially trained commandos to deal with \u00a0life-threatening enemy, the department is banking on an army, which lacks professionalism, orientation, commitment and accountability. This, when fever, dengue, chikungunya, leptospirosis, hepatitis A and B, malaria and scrub typhus have all increased manifold.\n\u00a0\nHealth Minister V S Sivakumar makes lofty statements about pumping in crores of rupees for medicines. Experts attribute the recurring and growing cases of communicable diseases to the failure to lay more focus on surveillance and preventive measures.\n\u00a0\nThe increase in lifestyle diseases including high cholesterol, sugar levels and blood pressure had lowered the resistance of people across the state resulting in increasing morbidity and mortality due to fever.\n\u00a0\nVarious committees in the past including Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) working group report on medical and public health had recommended setting up of an exclusive public health cadre and professionally qualified leadership for public health sector.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe definitely need a group of people trained in public health management. They should be given full mandate to implement disease prevention and control programmes. We also need rapid response teams considering the recurrence of communicable diseases,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Dr V Ramankutty at Achutha Menon Centre for Health Sciences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut not many doctors are willing to work in public health sector. There are no incentives for doctors who want to opt for public health. Even the Central Government has tied up with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta, for raising an exclusive trained public health cadre.\n\u00a0\nCommunicable disease prevention expert Thomas Mathew says there are manpower and management issues involved in implementing prevention programmes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot only public health officials but operational experts, who are good at managing, organising such activities and motivating the ground staff are needed. This is a full-fledged war. Either you defeat the enemy or perish,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Dr Mathew.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe current system has mainly regular doctors handling administrative responsibilities of DMO, DHS or control programmes. Most of them are specialists or general medics and have limited experience in operational and management issues.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThough the health department had constituted an exclusive administrative cadre for non-specialist doctors, none is trained in public health issues.\u00a0Even Accredited Social Health Activists, responsible for ground-level disease prevention, are burdened with other programmes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat is more scary is the huge inward migration of workers. Many of those from Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal are also bringing in dengue, malaria and even fatal Kala Azar or black fever. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou cannot quarantine everyone. Immediate measures are required to increase surveillance in and around labour camps and places of work,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Dr Mathew, adding that the State needed a zero tolerance policy towards communicable diseases.\nStates:\u00a0\n\n XXXXXX  Deccan Chronicle"}

The data from 2006 to 2013 show that the state has been witnessing a rapid increase in the prevalence of communicable diseases, with 2013 being the worst year. Diarrhoea, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid and leptospirosis are the diseases that pose a major threat to the state, says the health department report. Diarrhoea has become the worst fear and experts cite scarcity of pure drinking water and unhygienic conditions in households as the main reason. In 2013 alone, 409,512 diarrhoea cases were reported in the state. The districts that were worst hit were Mallappuram (85,984), Palakkad (49,066), Thrissur (47,336) and Ernakulam (28,054). Another fear is of dengue fever  . Kerala earned the dubious distinction as the dengue capital of the country in 2013. With 7,911 cases and 25 deaths, Kerala recorded the maximum number of dengue cases last year. Thiruvananthapuram was worst hit with 4,188 cases followed by Malappuram (520), Kollam (490), Pathanamthitta (485) and Kottayam (410). A total of 6,440 hepatitis cases and 28 deaths caused by it were reported last year. Contaminated water is the main cause of hepatitis A. The community medicine department of Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital had cautioned against consuming soda, ice cubes, ice sticks and welcome drinks served in marriages. Of the cases, 5,329 were hepatitis A and 1,111 were hepatitis B. More number of hepatitis A cases were reported from Kollam (1,885) followed by Kozhikode (1,801) and Wayanad (785). Last year, 2,975 cases of typhoid were reported from the state. Of this, only one death was reported. Most cases were reported from Thiruvananthapuram (898) followed by Malappuram (536), Palakkad (531) and Wayanad (428). Similarly, leptospirosis cases were reported in the state. Of the 796 cases, 26 deaths occurred. Thiruvananthapuram recorded the maximum number of cases with 310 followed by Ernakulam (161) and Alappuzha with 71 cases. Other communicable diseases reported in the state last year were malaria   (1,137) with two deaths, chikungunya (249), cholera (20), scrub typhus (66) and hand foot mouth disease (243). In one year, 29,10,018 cases of fever were reported in different hospitals across the state. From 2006 to 2013, if chikungunya and leptospirosis cases did not show a very steep increase, dengue and diarrhoea were a cause for concern. Dengue cases reported in 2006 were just 1,019 where as it was 7,911 in 2013. Similarly, diarrhoea cases were 300,486 in 2006, it increased to 409,512 in 2013.

To make matters worse, hospital authorities have not ruled out the possibility of more such cases getting detected in the next few days.\nMost of the patients afflicted by the mosquito-borne disease are from Inder Road, Dalanwala and Bhagat Singh Road. Stagnant water found in these areas have tested positive with the virus, state health department confirmed, adding that dengue virus has spread due to the city receiving alternating spells of sunshine and rainfall in the last few days.\nCity hospitals have begun to quarantine dengue patients to arrest the fear of an outbreak. Apart from Doon Hospital, three other privately-run hospitals have set up a different ward for patients.\nChief medical officer (CMO) B S Jangpangi told TOI that he had asked hospitals to give \"utmost priority\" to dengue patients. \"We are also sending some samples to a private hospital for ELISA + test (a test that confirms whether a patient is suffering from dengue) to get the results quickly in order to begin treatment soon,\" he said.\nCMO Jangpangi has also asked ASHA (accredited social health activists) and rural medical workers to focus on educating people in the city about the potential outbreak, especially in slums and rural areas adjoining the capital city.\n\"We have started a door-to-door awareness campaign to make people aware about the dangers of stagnant water in their area. Social activists are informing people to keep a check on water coolers, refrigerators and other such places where water can be stored,\" Jangpangi said. \"Still water provides the ideal breeding ground for the aedes aegypti, mosquitoes that carry the dengue-causing flavi virus.\"\nThe Health department's office bearers are also visiting various government schools to test students. If the test is positive, students are then taken to the nearby hospital. They have also started conducting rounds of anti-dengue misting and disinfection around the city from Thursday.\nThe dengue virus-laden mosquitoes mostly bite in evenings, especially in the highly vascular parts of the body such as ankle and neck.\nDengue should be suspected when high fever (104\u00b0F) is accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash. The symptoms usually last for 2-7 days, after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito, doctors said.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Mosquito,Hospital,fever,Doon Hospital,DENGUE\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

The ELISA test facility is only available with Doon district hospital and Himalayan Hospital.\nBut, they haven\u2019t reported\u00a0 any dengue cases now, said district incharge of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), Jagdish Bahuguna. Shri Mahant Indresh Hospital, a private hospital situated in Patel Nagar, however, had reported seven dengue cases in last one week. Out of seven cases, two patients belonged to the capital, three to Saharanpur and one each to Roorkee and Haridwar.\nThe hospital has already made an isolated ward for dengue patients and has also confirmed availability of blood platelets for the patients. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dehradun district, BS Jangpangi said, \u201cThe hospital has conducted rapid response test on blood samples of dengue patients. This test isn\u2019t confirmatory as the results could be vague. ELISA is the primary test for detecting dengue.\u201d\nAt Shri Mahant Indresh hospital, blood samples of dengue patients are tested with the help of Immunochromatography assays. This, according to hospital experts, is equivalent to ELISA test to detect presence of dengue in blood samples. \u201cImmunochromatography or IC is equally viable test like ELISA. We have been doing it since years. Unlike ELISA test which takes at least a day to detect presence of dengue in blood samples, Immunochromatography test takes only one hours to ascertain whether the patient is ailing with dengue or not,\u201d head of department microbiology at Mahant Indresh Hopsiptal, Dr BS Mahawal said.\nHe said that SB Bioline, a government of India approved company provides Immunochromatography ssays test kits. Also known as lateral flow test, it is the cheaper way of confirming dengue unlike ELISA. Officials from Integrated Disease and Surveillance Project (IDSP) have already contacted Mahant Indresh Hospital authorities for serum samples of the patients the hospital claimed tested positive.\nThe serum samples will be tested at Doon District Hospital with the help of ELISA test. IDSP officials through this, will prepare a database of affected patients. Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) state incharge Dr Kiran Bisht told HT, \u201cWe will first confirm the samples with the help of ELISA test. It\u2019s on the basis of this test that we will confirm them dengue patients.\u201d\n\n XXXXXX  Hindustan Times"}

Rao\nEven as several patients afflicted with dengue in some tribal habitations under Penagadapa and other gram panchayats in Kothagudem division recovering gradually, new dengue cases continue to trickle in from both the Agency and plain areas of the district at the district headquarters hospital in Khammam.\nThe official estimates put the figure of dengue positive cases at 157 and malaria cases at little over 1,700 in the district so far.\nBut the unofficial figures put the tally at more than 200 as several cases remained unreported from various private hospitals in the district and elsewhere in the State.\nAlthough a government doctor reportedly died of dengue at a private hospital in Hyderabad last month, the district health officials are yet to ascertain the exact cause of the death.\nThey insist that not a single dengue death has been reported from anywhere in the district this year.\nAs many as seven dengue positive cases were reported from Penagadapa in Kothagudem mandal over a couple of weeks ago. Also, four persons died of various ailments in the village last month. However, the health authorities attributed these deaths to ailments like cardiac disorders and viral encephalitis.\nMeanwhile, the Sentinel Surveillance Centre in the district headquarters hospital is flooded with patients suffering from suspected dengue fever from all over the district and adjoining areas of the neighbouring States.\nThe hospital is grappling with space problem to accommodate patients with fevers. The fever ward in the hospital is overcrowded, said an attendant of a dengue patient from Madhira mandal.\n\u201cWe have come here all the way from our remote village in Palvancha mandal to avail the services of the Sentinel Surveillance Centre in the hospital,\u201d said a woman, who accompanied a dengue patient to the hospital.\nThere is an urgent need to set up sentinel surveillance centres with ELISA and Platelet machines at the government area hospitals in Kothagudem, Palvancha and Bhadrachalam towns, contended Nayini Raju, secretary, CPI (ML-ND), Yellendu division.\nIt\u2019s an ordeal for patients from the forest fringe villages to avail diagnostic and other medical services for dengue in the absence of such facilities in Kothagudem, he pointed out.\nMore than 14 special medical and screening camps involving microbiologists, epidemiologists, entomologists, district surveillance officers and other medical staff were conducted in the entire district in the last three months, said A. Rambabu, District Malaria Officer.\nHealth problems in Adilabad go unaddressed\nS. Harpal Singh\nThe tribal people of Tatiguda hamlet in Danthanpalli gram panchayat of Utnoor mandal approach a private doctor in Indervelli mandal headquarters, about 30 km away, in the event of sickness.\nNothing could be more illustrative of the deplorable condition of health care in Adilabad, especially in the agency area of the district, as Adivasis travel 30 km to go to a private doctor despite having a full-fledged primary health centre just 300 meters away from their village and its sub-centre right in the village itself.\nGawde Lachu Patel, the headman of this 56-house Gond tribe village, is down with some undiagnosed fever and stomach ache since past 15 days. He has been consuming the medicine prescribed by the Indervelli doctor, not that the medicine has made any difference to his pathetic condition.\nArka Manku and his young daughter Sombai are bedridden with some mysterious fever since the last five days, but have refrained from visiting the sub-centre next door. Nor has the Auxiliary Nurse and Midwife (ANM) from the centre bothered to visit them. No medical staff have visited the hamlet to collect blood samples and conduct other tests to determine the diseases haunting almost every family in this village.\nEven as the agency is fraught with severe health problems, the government has wriggled out of the tricky situation taking advantage of the hullabaloo created over prevalence of dengue and malaria. As the focus of accusations and denials remained centered around deaths due to dengue, Health Minister T. Rajaiah successfully kept himself from explaining the cause of the unusually high number of deaths that have taken place in the agency during the season.\nThe government has conceded 181 deaths, which includes two suspected dengue cases and two malarial deaths during the year, the majority during monsoon. \u201cThe prevalence of typhoid has not been determined,\u201d revealed a senior medical officer in the agency, as he talked about the probable reasons for such a high incidence of deaths.\nThe revelation gains importance in the light of the fact that illnesses like typhoid require treatment for longer durations for which the hospitals in the agency are ill-equipped. \u201cAs poverty restrains the tribal people from accessing prolonged treatment at better hospitals in the district headquarter, the government should address this problem with equal enthusiasm,\u201d observes the doctor.\nIncidence of fever has come down in Warangal\nGollapudi Srinivasa Rao\nWith the end of the rainy season, the incidence of fever has come down in the agency areas of the district. The severity that was witnessed in September and October is no longer there. However, regular fever cases are being reported at government and private hospitals here.\nAccording to officials, in Mulug division covering Eturunagaram, Mangapet and other agency mandals, only two dengue cases were reported \u2013 one in Rayanigudem and one at Pasra. In all, five malaria cases were reported in the entire division this season.\nKondaparthi village where the incidence of malaria is high every year is safe at present. The residents of hamlets in these agency mandals complain that they were not given mosquito nets by the ITDA as was the practice earlier. A resident of Mulug, Sammaiah, said there were no ambulances for emergencies.\nThe ITDA has also reportedly stopped fogging the areas for want of funds. Deputy Chief Minister T. Rajaiah held a review meeting recently at Eturunagaram and promised to pump in more funds, which has not materialised yet.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

XXXXXX Updated: October 21, 2014 00:29 IST\nHave dengue deaths breached official figures?\nM. Sai Gopal\nAedes Albopictus mosquito which transmits the Chikungunya virus. French autorities announced on September 26, 2010 a second case of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus on its mainland, in the French southeastern city of Frejus.\nTOPICS\nhealth\nThe Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is the primary vector that causes dengue in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts. Senior doctors believe the number of fatalities in the city may be more than what has been officially reported.\nThe health authorities may not admit it but cases of dengue continue to be reported from Hyderabad and elsewhere in Telangana. With there being little effort to share information on suspected cases of dengue between authorities and private hospitals in the capital, senior doctors here believe the numbers could be more than what is being \u2018officially\u2019 projected.\nOfficial figures\u00a0say 62 suspected cases of dengue were reported from Hyderabad this year, of which, authorities say, only four tested positive at the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM). The situation is however different in the rest of the State, with officials confirming 350 cases that tested positive. Adilabad had the highest number with 127 positive dengue cases.\nSenior doctors say there is a need to concentrate more on preventive aspects and ensure that private hospitals report suspected cases on a regular basis. Physicians lament that dengue occurs in spite of the fact that people are aware that the disease spikes at a particular time of the year and is preventable.\nThe Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is the primary vector that causes dengue in Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy districts. Named after the white-and-black stripes on its body, the mosquito has lived up to its billing of being aggressive, as entomologists here note that over the years dengue has become endemic, and the mosquito itself poses a clear danger to public safety.\n\u201cThe fight against the Aedes mosquito should be throughout the year and not [limited to] just [a] few months. The mosquito itself is very aggressive in nature and unlike other mosquitoes, this one bites all day. It\u2019s breeding is prolific and is a known vector for Chikungunya,\u201d says Associate Professor of Zoology at Osmania University B. Reddya Naik.\nDoctors say basic precautions are enough to ward off attacks.\n\u201cIt is preventable, but nobody bothers to take precautionary steps. Rather than undergoing the painful treatment, it\u2019s better to take preventive measures,\u201d says former Superintendent of Gandhi Hospital B. Balraju.\nDistrict officials maintain that the worst is over.\n\u201cIn another fortnight, we can expect a fall in cases. Private hospitals are simply declaring dengue cases positive if the blood platelet count of patients drop. Unless IPM confirms it, we can\u2019t confirm a dengue case. Public should observe dry day at least once a week,\u201d says Hyderabad DM&HO P. Venkateswar Rao.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

This has led to less breeding of mosquitoes, said GVMC officials.\n\"There is less spread of malaria this year as compared with last year. We have to attribute the drastic fall of malaria cases to the delayed or inactive monsoon,\" said Y Mani, biologist, department of public health, GVMC.\nThere were 1,200 malaria positive cases from January 1 to June 27 last year. However, this year the number has dropped to 900, according to Mani. In the rainy season from June 1 to June 27 there were 290 cases this year, compared to 370 cases in the corresponding period of the previous year, Mani said.\n\"Plasmodium falciparum, which is a major parasite, is solely responsible for each malaria-attributable death. We are taking utmost care to prevent the spread of such mosquitoes in the city,\" Mani said.\n\"No deaths were reported till date. However, we collect blood smears of suspected cases. We have collected nearly 40,000 blood smears from January 1 to June 27 this year. Out of them, 900 cases were reported as positive,\" said a senior medical officer from GVMC.\nGVMC chief medical officer M Satyanarayana Raju said that apart from the abnormal weather conditions, the extensive awareness camps till June end and spraying of malathene and fogging operations also led to the decrease of malaria cases in the city. The civic body has so far identified 34 sensitive areas where extra care needs to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, Raju said.\nMost of the cases are reported from slums and settlements near construction sites where people store water in open vessels, facilitating mosquito breeding, said GVMC officials. District health officials, including malaria officer KVS Prasad Rao, said that unlike rural areas where breeding happens mostly after spells of rain, the use of artificial containers and presence of slums makes the city an ideal abode for these parasites.\nMani said that GVMC is using Gambusia fish as part of its measures to prevent the spread of mosquitoes. The city has nearly 4,000 wells and 20 open ponds, many of them in the Gajuwaka region, said Mani. The department is not spending money on Gambusia as the GVMC owns five plants to rear fish, at Town Kottaroad, NAD Kottaroad, Sitammadhara North Extension, Pendurthy and Muralinagar Park.\nRaju said that GVMC would concentrate on low-lying spots that are prone to breeding mosquitoes because of water stagnation during continuous or massive rains. Some of the areas where there are chances of waterlogging are Kobbaritotha, MVP sector-10 and 11, Prasad Gardens, Poorna Market, Suryateja Nagar, HB Colony, VS Krishna College, Indira Nagar and Railway New Colony.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Monsoon,malaria cases\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Summary   In some people the disease progresses to a severe, often fatal, form known as dengue hemorrhagic fever.   Health dept inspects 300 houses in one day after man found with dengue fever   Dengue cases may be 4 times more common than known   Health dept gears up as dengue cases rise in city   Scientists have unveiled the mechanism behind how dengue enters cells of our immune system, a finding that could help develop vaccine for the deadly virus.  Dengue fever, an infectious tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus, afflicts millions of people each year, causing fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and a characteristic skin rash, researchers said. In some people the disease progresses to a severe, often fatal, form known as dengue hemorrhagic fever.  Despite its heavy toll, the prevention and clinical treatment of dengue infection has been a &#8220;dramatic failure in public health compared to other infectious diseases like HIV,&#8221; said Ping Liu of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Now, new research by Liu and her colleagues could offer vital insight into the mechanism of dengue virus entry into cells &#8211; and aid vaccine and clinical drug development. Liu along with dengue fever expert Aravinda de Silva, used high-resolution microscopes to examine the expression of a particular protein, known as DC-SIGN, on the surface of immune system cells called dendritic cells.  The normal role of DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin) is to capture pathogens so that fragments of those pathogens can be presented as antigens on the surface of the dendritic cells.  Such antigens then are recognised by T cells \u2013 the workhorse cells of the immune system &#8211; &#8220;which is one of the first steps in the normal immune response,&#8221; Liu said. While it has been known for some time that dengue used DC-SIGN to attach to cells, Liu and her colleagues used high-resolution microscopy to study exactly how the viruses used the protein to gain entry into cells.  &#8220;DC-SIGN has a unique carbohydrate recognition domain on its extracellular portion, which binds to all sorts of carbohydrates on pathogens,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;An effective medication or vaccine should stop the process of dengue virus entry into cells,&#8221; Liu said. She said, de Silva and his colleagues have identified strong neutralisation antibodies that block dengue infection. neutralisation, Liu and colleagues hope to advance the development of vaccines for dengue virus infections.

Continuous rain for the last few days has caused water stagnation and overflowing of sewage lines leading to spread of diseases, especially viral fever and dengue.\n\n \n\n Over the last three weeks, the city has been witnessing an increase in the number of dengue and viral infection cases, doctors say. Though not all cases have been confirmed as dengue cases yet, doctors say clinical symptoms pointing to the illness is adequate proof.\n\n \n\n \"In our ward, presently, there are three patients with dengue and some others who are suffering from symptoms pointing to the same,\" says Dr A Jaleel Ahmed, pediatrician at G Kuppusamy Naidu Hospital. \"There is a sudden surge in the number of such cases that is accompanied with high fever, body pain and fatigue,\" he adds.\n\n \n\n Doctors say they are not waiting to serologically confirm probable dengue cases because the NS1 test available now only checks for anti-bodies, which are produced only two days after the infection manifests. \"The World Health Organisation has issued guidelines that doctors can diagnose and treat patients for dengue on clinical basis,\" says Dr Ahmed. \"We have been advised to admit patients showing clinical symptoms of dengue with warning signs like shock or bleeding,\" he added.\n\n \n\n Apart from dengue, doctors say the number of viral fever and cold cases in the city have also risen. \"We see 150 to 200 patients a day of which 90% come in with fever. Again 90% of them are due to viral infections,\" says Dr D Dhandapani, who runs Balaji Hospitals in Sundarapuram. \"It usually begins with a sore or itchy throat, and progresses to a running nose and a full blown cold. Sometimes, the fever is only accompanied by body pain,\" he added.\n\n \n\n \"We usually treat them with a mild antibiotic, paracetamol and other mild medicines for body pain or cold,\" said Dr Dhandapani.\n\n \n\n Doctors say increase in fever cases during this time of the year is common due to the NE monsoons that are accompanied with the winds carrying airborne infections. \"This year it has set in late. It usually sets in as early as July,\" he added.\n\n \n\n While viral infections are difficult to prevent, public health authorities are taking efforts to control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and malaria. \"We are being very cautious about water stagnation and mosquito breeding sources in private and public buildings. It is proven that control of mosquito population directly leads to the number of cases falling. We are adopting the same strategy,\" said a senior public health department official.\n\n"}

Dr A Jayavardhana, paediatrician at PSG Hospitals too confirmed that they had seen at least 10 patients showing symptoms of dengue. \"Since we have not done any tests to confirm if they are dengue positive, we have not reported it,\" he said.\n\n \n\n The disease's return this month however has been termed sporadic by public health officials at the Coimbatore Corporation. \"The reported cases are one each from localities including Singanallur, Kuniyamuthur, Ramnagar and Thudiyalur,\" said a senior health department official. Doctors reported cases from in-and-around Sundarapuram, Dharapuram and Avinashi.\n\n \n\n However, official numbers continue to be low because it has not been made compulsory to test patients showing symptoms of the vector-borne disease to confirm it. Cases are reported only when the blood samples test positive for the IGM Elisa test. However, this test only checks for anti-bodies produced to fight dengue. Anti-bodies are usually produced only in the second week of the disease. \"If we test patients in the first week of the disease, they usually test negative,\" said Dr Jayavardhana. \"So we usually take their blood samples just before they are discharged,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Most doctors decide to test the patient's blood samples only if his platelet count falls below one lakh, starts developing rashes or if he suffers from any form of bleeding or shock. \"However, we follow the gold standard of looking for symptoms. Our diagnosis is mostly positive when we test them. So we usually start treating them when we notice the symptoms,\" says Dr Jayavardhana.\n\n \n\n Corporation officials said they had no plans to make testing or reporting of suspected dengue cases compulsory. \"It anyway requires only supportive management of paracetamols and IV fluids. Testing and confirming its dengue only helps public health services and not the patients individually,\" said a corporation official. \"So we do not want to make it compulsory,\" the official said.\n\n \n\n Officials say as an extra precaution, block level officers closely track fever cases that have led to admission into hospitals. \"Once a patient gets admitted for fever, we anyway start tracking their progress. If we suspect dengue, we immediately visit their residence and check for breeding sources,\" added the official.\n\n"}

A brief spell of rain on Tuesday didn't just bring down the temperature but also ensured more cases of dengue. In the past four days, there have been four cases of dengue. With 12 new cases of dengue and 20 of malaria recorded in the past 15 days, the total so far this year has touched 19 and 64, respectively.\nDr V K Thapar, district malaria officer, said, \"Due to changes in weather conditions, mid-September usually sees an increase in disease occurrence. Now, with a brief spell of rain, some new cases have come up once again. There are indeed chances of more cases coming up.\" He advised people to use mosquito repellants, maintain hygiene and check accumulation of water in their areas.\nThe health department has identified 2,867 indoor locations in urban areas that serve as breeding grounds of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes and 9,500 outdoor spots. Over 80% of these larvae are of Aedes mosquito which carries dengue.\nGurgaon has also been identified as a dengue-prone district by the state health department. It has called a special team of insect collectors from other districts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Faridabad and Hisar. The insect collector in the city retired in 2013, and the position has been vacant since then.

According to Civil Hospital's epidemiology department, all three dengue patients are male, and belong to Sikandarpur, Sector 56 and Nakhrola village. The department informed that more than 50% of the suspected cases are from rural areas. It also reported 53 cases of malaria.\nDr Rajesh Kumar of Paras Hospital blamed construction sites as the main cause behind the spread of the disease. \"Most of the cases are from areas where there is ongoing construction work. That's why we get more sufferers from rural areas, as they work on construction sites.\" He, however, cautioned those living in AC environments as well, saying that the aedes aegypti mosquito, responsible for transmitting dengue, can easily breed and survive in temperatures less than 24 degrees Celsius.\nVikas Kumar, who lives in Sikanderpur village and suffered from dengue last year, also blamed construction work around his village for the spread of dengue. \"Every year, there are at least four cases in this village. The big reason is construction of underpasses and buildings, which leave open holes and other vessels that collects rain water, which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes. You'll hardly see any health workers here, as the corporation doesn't care about the villages,\" he said.\nWhen asked about the steps taken by the health department to fight the deadly disease, Dr V K Thappar said the department has been running an active anti-larval operation. \"A team of 50 health workers is working day and night to collect larvae samples from both rural and urban areas. We're also carrying out door-to-door surveillance for fever cases and keeping an eye on potential mosquito-breeding sources,\" he said.\nHe advised people to use nets on doors, windows and ventilators to keep mosquitoes out of houses and not allow water to accumulate on terraces or in coolers. He also stressed that people should see a general physician if they get severe headache, fever or/and eye and stomach pain.\nThappar further said patients who have a past history of dengue need to be more careful. \"There are four serotypes of the dengue virus. If one has had dengue fever in the past, his/her body generally overreacts to a repeat attack. Thus, those who suffered from dengue last year, especially with serotypes 2 and 4, should be more careful. Those who had viral fever at the start of the season should also take extra precautionary measures,\" he explained.\nIn 2013, over 55 dengue cases were reported till August. Even though the situation appeared to be better this year, some doctors expressed concern as cases are sometimes reported till November. \"Dengue cases begin to appear in July and August and continue till September. However, the severity of cases rises by end season, as anti-bodies cross react within time frame of three to 12 months. Therefore, not only is intensifying the anti-mosquito drive important, so is spreading awareness about the disease,\" said Kumar.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

But the good news is the city has seen fewer cases of the fever (404) so far this year than last year when 1,047 were reported and even\u00a0 2012 when 868 were recorded in Bengaluru.\nAlso, there have been no deaths from the disease so far this year unlike in 2013 when there were 12 and 2012 when the fever claimed 21 lives in the city.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nAsk BBMP deputy health officer, Dr Naveen and he says there have been fewer cases of dengue this year only because the monsoon has not been as intense.\nClearly this explanation gives no room for complacency and with the garbage problem looming large in the horizon with the deadline for dumping at Mandur\u00a0 fast approaching, the city cannot afford not to take precautions.\u00a0\nSays BBMP commissioner, M Lakshminarayana, \u201cWe are seeing fewer cases of dengue now in the city after the rains.

Many have money plants, which are a breeding ground for mosquitoes, in their homes.\nPeople need to change the water frequently. Again in slums like Vidyaranyapura we see discarded coconut shells filed with water, which are a major breeding ground for mosquitoes,\u201d she says.\nWhile the BBMP claims it is distributing pamphlets among people on the precautions that needs to be taken, it has given no instructions to its health inspectors to bring leaks in the water and sanitary lines to the attention of BWSSB engineers to prevent large stagnant pools of water forming on city roads that make localities around vulnerable to outbreak of diseases like dengue.\nSays Ms Binu Paul of Koramangala, who had dengue fever not too long ago, \u201cThere is no doubt that this trend will persist. There is a huge garbage dump right in front of my house.\nPeople randomly come and throw garbage bags from their posh vehicles here.

XXXXXX Gastroenteritis outbreak just a few water sips away   As diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis cases gain traction, docs know where the blame lies in contaminated water   Rising mercury levels have impacted patient inflow at hospitals across the city: More people are queuing up in front of doctors complaining about infections! The culprit, so far, is water contamination. Physicians across Bangalore are receiving a large number of patients complaining of medical conditions like gastroenteritis (viral infection) and typhoid fever (bacterial infection), along with symptoms of liver abscess (pus-filled cavity within the liver, with types caused by bacteria as well as amoeba). CONTAMINATION SUSPECT   Doctors say that water from tankers is the main culprit. Dr Pankaj Singhai, Head of the Department of Internal Medicine, Manipal Hospital, says: \"I have been seeing 2-3 patients daily who fall sick mainly because of water contamination, which in turn leads to E. coli infections and other bacterial and parasitic infections. The root cause of this is probably the tanker water supplied to houses, which many people tend to buy due to insufficient supply of piped water. We do not know how this water is processed, and in case this is consumed, it will lead to people falling sick and getting low-grade fever.\" Doctors say the patients come with symptoms of fever, diarrhoea, and pain in the abdomen. In fact, many cases of hepatitis A and E (both transmitted by contaminated water) have also been on the rise in the city. Cases of water contamination were also reported from Mysore Road and several pockets of Bangalore, causing severe health issues to residents. While measures like UV filters are popular, doctors say that the best way to purify water is to boil it. \"Only when you boil water can you be sure that the germs have been killed,\" Dr Singhai says. Dr Umesh Jalihal, consultant (surgical) gastroenterologist, MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital, says: \"Many often tend to eat street food which are sold on carts placed right next to storm water drains, and the virus generally tends to multiply faster in this season.\" The scene is worse in government hospitals. A gastroenterologist at Victoria Hospital sees at least 50-60 patients of hepatitis fever on a daily basis. But many also make the mistake of not drinking enough water during summer, which may lead to dehydration. Physicians say this is the season of gastroenteritis outbreak, which would later be followed by jaundice. So it pays to be careful, though there's no outbreak as yet. Most acute cases of diarrhoea do come from food handlers, doctors say. \"When it comes to street food, many people come with complaints of acute diarrhoea because of eating chaat and other street food. We do not know what kind of water is mixed into it. There is no outbreak yet and most of the cases have been outpatients,\" Dr G M Prasad, general physician of Columbia Asia Hospital says. TAKE NO CHANCES   \u00bb Boil water instead of using UV filters  \u00bb Say a strict no to street food  \u00bb Do not be too cautious and dehydrate yourself  \u00bb Carry a bottle of water wherever you go  \u00bb In case you see water contamination, report it to the nearest BWSSB office.

All the five deaths have been reported from Sidhi district where 60 tribals have tested positive. According to health officials, the condition is worse in Jhulua Tola village, about 20 km from Sidhi headquarters. In November 2011, more than 97 people had died of malaria in the district, which led to removal of the then chief medical and health officer and the collector as the issue had triggered a massive political outburst from the Left and the Congress parties. The officials put under suspension on Thursday for negligence and wrong reporting in Sidhi district include malaria officer Akhilesh Dubey and IDSP nodal officer JP Arya. Sidhi collector Vishesh Gadhpale admitted that there had been a flaw in reporting deaths on the officials\u2019 part. He has served a notice on chief medical and health officer (CMHO) KK Shukla, asking him to report the exact details immediately. Shukla, however, didn\u2019t respond to HT calls. District collector said only two deaths had been from malaria in the region. A team is camping in the village and all the residents are out of danger. \"We are examining them and keeping a close eye on the area. Sixty people have been tested positive and treatment is going on,\" he said. A health official, on condition of anonymity, admitted that the department was neither reporting the exact number of cases to the district administration not carrying out regular anti-malaria fogging in the village. Even investigation were not being carried out and there were no arrangements for proper treatment despite 2011 tragedy, he alleged. Veer Bhadur Singh, a villager of Jhola Tola, said that malarial outbreak had been there since October but the officials made no preventive steps to check its spread. Reasons behind the deaths 1. Cases not reported properly 2. Inappropriate treatment and apathy of the department concerned 3. Lack of hygiene and sanitation in tribal areas 4. Cases not notified and followed seriously 5. Quacks were active in the region owing to the unavailability of the doctors. Deaths reported 1. Ramesh Kol (10), resident of Pokahra in Bharuhi village panchayat (died on 27 October) 2. Mahobi Kol (50), resident of Bharuhi village panchayat (died on 29 October) 3. Rajnish Kol (13), resident of Jholu Tota (Monday) 4. Reena (16), resident of Jholu Tola village (died on Wednesday) 5.

Malaria caused by this species is most dangerous form of malaria, with the highest rates of complications and mortality. \n\n\n\n The outbreak has called for team of 21 experts from Regional Medical Research Center for Tribals (RMRCT) from Jabalpur to conduct surveys on number of patients, their treatment and cause of prevalence of malaria in the region. \n\n\n\n Inspector general of police, Bastar range SRP Kalluri told TOI, \"The RMRCT team would conduct survey at five identified districts of Bastar division at Kanker, Kondagaon, Bastar, Sukma and Bijapur from November 28 to December 15.\" \n\n\n\n \"Over 20 jawans were diagnosed with malaria from a new camp at Jheeram valley which came up only last week, eight jawans were airlifted to Raipur hospital. With onset of winters the disease erupts usually at new camps and now jawans from other states dread coming to this part of Chhattisgarh or joining a new camp. The area to endemic to malaria and even jawans with strong immunity fall sick to mosquito bites,\" Kalluri said. \n\n\n\n However, according to reports more than 100 jawans from Bastar division were diagnosed with malaria with large number of jawans from Chintagufa and Katekalyan, Konta and Jagargunda. \n\n\n\n IG said that the jawans were facilitated with mosquito nets and odomos anti-mosquito repellant to keep safe but they have to spend lot of time in forests so it wasn't possible to use them every time. \n\n\n\n However, jawans believe it was not just the mosquito but also water that cause spread of disease very fast. There's popular belief among them, \"Yaha pani piyo aur bimar pado\" (drink water here, and fall sick), a jawan said. \n\n\n\n According to district malaria officer Dr Ashwini Dewangan, although jawans work under inhospitable conditions, few preventive measures may act like a boon for them. \n\n\n\n \"While using repellant, regular fogging in region, mosquito nets are among basic preventive measures, indoor residual spray can be used in the camps to stay safe. Covering stagnant water near the camp with sand or making way to it to drain out would not cause breeding of mosquitoes. However, putting Gambusia fishes which are easily available, in the ponds or water bodies will help to a great extent as the fish feeds on mosquitoes' larvae,\" Dr Dewangan said. \n\n\n\n While Chhattisgarh stands second in country with 78,974 malaria cases this year, as per the latest statistics of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme statistics, the report shows four malaria related deaths reported in Chhattisgarh so far this year. \n\n\n\n However, according to statistics of police department about 40 jawans die every year in Bastar division."}

The state alone accounts for almost 13% of the total malaria cases in the country with almost 39,000 people falling prey to the disease.\nAccording to the latest data of the Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Chhattisgarh reported 38,781 cases from January to June this year, second only to neighbouring Odisha, which reported a whopping 1.30 lakh cases. According to the data, Jharkhand trails with 26,588 cases followed by Madhya Pradesh (18,793) and Tripura (13,375).\nDuring the same period, the total number of malaria cases recorded across the country was 3.19 lakh cases, which claimed 107 lives. Luckily, so far no fatality has been reported this year from Chhattisgarh. However, last year 43 people had died due to the disease in the state. While maximum number of three deaths this year has been recorded from Madhya Pradesh, doctors say the toll could be higher across the country, as many fatalities that occur in private hospitals are not reported.\nAccording to health officials, \"Malaria control in Chhattisgarh is a complex issue because of vast tracts of forest land with tribal settlement.\" The officials said majority of cases in the state are reported in Bastar division, which includes Dantewada and Kanker districts. Unplanned growth of cities, rapid industrialisation, labour concentration at project sites and movement of population across the borders are some of the reasons for high number of malaria cases in the last few years.\nOn the positive side, there has been a considerable reduction in cases and deaths since 2010,\" said V Jaiprakash, state nodal officer, NVBDCP.Jaiprakash said the easiest, cheapest and most environment-friendly method to control malaria is by preventing the mosquito from laying eggs.\n\"Avoiding or eliminating water collection can do this with ease\", he said adding that a little caution by the people can go a long way in malaria prevention.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=NVBDCP,malaria cases\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

They were running high temperature and when the medicines they took did not prove effective, they were brought to sadar hospital. Both of them tested dengue positive here, sources said. Rashmi Kumari stays in New Delhi and had come back to her ancestral village only recently. Shashi Kumar studies in Patna and had come home in Purnia during the festivals, sources said. \"They recently took ill and their parents and guardians initially believed it might be due to the change in season.

They argue that the numbers must be revised to enable policymakers to strengthen strategies for better management and prevention. \n\n\n\n The NVBDCP reports around 20,000 laboratory confirmed cases every year, but the study found India had at least 6 million clinically diagnosed dengue cases between 2006 and 2012, said lead author Donald Shepard, professor, Brandeis Heller School for Social Policy and Management. \n\n\n\n \"We believe even that number may be low because dengue reporting is better in the area we studied -Tamil Nadu -than in most other states,\" he said. The study , published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene earlier this month, said dengue cases could cost the country at least $1.11 billion (around Rs 6,660 crore) a year in medical and other expenses. That is nearly 20% of India's health care budget in 2014. \n\n\n\n Officials at the Union ministry of health refused to comment on the study. \n\n\n\n In the last 10 years, many studies have shown a rapid increase in dengue cases and deaths. The populations of the dengue-causing mosquitoes called Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have also increased in many cities, said CRME director B K Tyagi. \n\n\n\n \"We lack good data because of how we have been collecting data from the government and private hospitals. Since dengue victims who see doctors in time can be cured, the country's medical system vastly underreports cases and deaths. Data is important because it helps policymakers understand the disease burden and prepare to control future outbreaks like the one we had in 2013 after heavy rain. Standing water allowed mosquito breeding and caused more than 55,000 cases of dengue that year,\" he said. \n\n\n\n The vector-borne disease causes fever and joint pain and if unattended may lead to hemorrhaging, shock and death. Experts say there are no effective anti-viral drugs to treat the disease, so public health authorities must initiate large scale vector control measures to prevent outbreaks. \n\n\n\n For the study, researchers collected data on patients hospitalized with the disease in Madurai between 2009 and 2011. They used this data, along with the list of surveillance da ta from 18 states and dengue experts to calculate a national estimate of annual dengue cases, including those treated as out-patients. \n\n\n\n They then estimated the cost using medical records of 1,541 patients treated in 10 medical college hospitals across the country from 2006 to 2011. In the final part of the study, the re searchers used those cost findings, along with the results of the Madurai analysis, to estimate the total annual economic burden of dengue in the country. \n\n\n\n While this study indicates that the economic and disease burdens of dengue in the country are hundreds of times greater than the estimates based entirely on official reports, researcher admit that further studies are needed. The authors declared that the study was funded through a contract with vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur, which has a dengue vaccine in late-stage clinical development, but the company, they said, was not involved in the actual research or in preparing the study for publication. \n\n\n\n Public health experts say the study warns not just about the viral epidemic in the country, but about the way in which disease surveillance happens. \n\n\n\n \"We have been told that we went wrong in Malaria. Now, we are told we are wrong in dengue too. Unless we have the right data we will not impress upon policy makers to bring in more strategies for prevention,\" said former TN public health director Dr S Elango. \n\n\n\n \"Take the example of the state quoted as the best example even in the study. In 2013, they have reported zero deaths in malaria, dengue and cholera. \n\n\n\n Ask any hospital and they will give you a list of patients who died,\" he said. They did. \n\n\n\n Doctors at Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital in Chennai said many children were admitted to the intensive care unit for dengue treatment and some of them died. \"We sent the death reports to the corporation. We still have the lab records that confirm dengue cases. We can show it to them anytime,\" said a doctor. \n\n\n\n Dr Elango said many infectious diseases should be notified by a doctor to the local health department so that authorities can take measures to prevent the spread. \"The officials refuse to act on prevention measure and risk out breaks. It happens not only in TN but across many states,\" he said. \n\n\n\n"}

Prof. Piot said the disease\u2019s nature and spread made it \u201cespecially challenging\u201d for the Indian health system. \u201cIt is particularly important to be vigilant and monitor people closely, and make sure the public are aware of the risks,\u201d Prof. Piot, who co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, said. He said Ebola could spread to any country, as the stray cases in Europe and the United States had shown. However, \u201cIn India, with its huge population and urban centres very densely packed, it could pose a challenge if any cases did arrive, as it is harder to isolate patients and trace their contacts for observation. Lack of adequate sanitation is also a problem in parts of the country. These elements could make containing Ebola cases more challenging than in some other countries.\u201d Added to this is the risk posed by the large number of people from India who work in West Africa and travel to and fro. \u201cThis is an opportunity for the Indian health service to strengthen its infection control measures in all hospitals in preparation for any cases of Ebola arriving in the country,\u201d Prof. Piot said. \u201cIt is very important that proper hygiene practices are observed in all health facilities, and that healthcare workers are properly trained to protect against the spread of the disease if any cases did arrive in India.\u201d He, however, opposed banning or disrupting flights out of the Ebola-infected regions of West Africa. \u201cThe current outbreak is already disrupting entire societies, and cutting off these countries from the rest of the world will only make the social and economic impacts worse,\u201d Prof. Piot said. The Ebola outbreak, first reported in March 2014, has taken the lives of 4,922 people up to October 23 in the five countries of Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the United States, besides causing one death in Mali. The focus of the international committee must be on fighting the outbreak in its heartland of West Africa \u2014 the \u201cbest way to ensure that the virus does not spread to other countries.\u201d The international community was \u201cmuch too slow\u201d in its response to the outbreak, the eminent researcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the U.K. and the United States and some other countries are finally beginning to help. But other countries, especially in Europe, must do a lot more.\u201d Ebola is not just an epidemic, but a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just need health care personnel on the ground in West Africa, but also logistics experts, trucks, jeeps and foodstuffs.\u201d"}

Every year, dengue cases sprout between July and September; the major causes are waterlogging along open drains and unhygienic conditions resulting from garbage piled along the road.\n\"This year, no case of dengue was reported due to the precautions that were taken, like regular cleaning of nullahs and removal of garbage. The recent cases are due to the rains that occurred over the last two days and caused waterlogging at many places. We are going to start a disinfection drive in the congested areas and conduct a survey to detect patients with high fever,\" said Udaykumar Bhat, head of Vector-borne Disease Control Programme of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation.\nDengue, a viral disease, is caused by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.\nThe intermittent rains followed a severe increase in the daytime temperatures. According to experts, when the temperature, the appetite of mosquitoes increases with the rising mercury. Mosquitoes shed larvae more frequently as well, whether in waterbodies or vessels that collect water.\nBhat said, \"The dengue cases have been confirmed by the private hospitals, but we are yet to receive the detailed reports. We will carry out separate blood tests of these patients at the central laboratory. We have directed these hospitals to keep a tab on the patients with high fever and send their blood samples to us for further analysis.\"\nThe Kolhapur civic administration takes up annual measures to destroy breeding sites of the dengue mosquito.\nPhysician Sandip Chavan said, \"Rains after high temperature creates a perfect condition for mosquitoes to breed.

Udit Thakur \u00a0\u00b7 Oct 13, 2014 \u00b7 12:30 pm Photo Credit: James Gathany Total Views About 20,000 Indians are hospitalised every year for dengue infections, according to government figures. Yet a new\u00a0 study \u00a0claims that the actual number of Indians affected by dengue could be six million a year, nearly 300 times greater than the government figures suggest. The study was funded through a contract with vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur, which has a dengue vaccine that is in the late stages of clinical development. However, the study\u2019s authors claim that the company was not involved in the actual research or preparation of the study. The difficulty in determining the prevalence of dengue cases in India arises because of the slippery nature of the infection. The stark reality is that many people in India have probably had it, but just not known about it. Four strains Dengue is transmitted to humans from the bite of a mosquito carrying one of the four strains of the virus. \u201cThere are four strains, so natural infection can happen at least four times,\u201d said Dr Narendra K Arora, executive director of the International Clinical Epidemiology Network, and co-author of the study. \u201cGiven that there are such a large number of infections annually, almost six million per year, at least at some point in your life it is extremely likely that you would be exposed to at least one strain.\u201d The\u00a0 effects \u00a0of being infected by only one strain of the virus are relatively minor, with symptoms like mild fever, severe headache and muscle and joint pain. The World Health Organisation says that aside from seeing a doctor, people with this kind of dengue fever should rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take paracetamol. But the real danger comes from cases of severe dengue (also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever), which affects mainly children and involves a potentially lethal combination of symptoms like fever, persistent vomiting, bleeding and breathing difficulty. The danger is exacerbated further by the fact that there is currently no vaccine for the disease. \u201cUsually the first episode is a mild episode,\u201d said Dr Arora. \u201cWhen exposed to a second strain your response is likely to be more severe,\u201d Discrepancy in reporting Calculating the real spread of dengue offers a lesson on the limitations faced by public health researchers today. On the one hand, only about 1% of dengue cases advance to life-threatening stage, which must be a factor in the government\u2019s low assessments. At the same time, issues with reporting and monitoring of diagnosed cases can often lead to discrepancies. \u201cThe issue with many of the probable cases is that we cannot be sure if we are handling dengue or other forms of fever,\u201d said Dr AC Dhariwal, director of the Ministry of Health\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. \u201cWe have this problem of distinguishing between probable cases and confirmed cases in dealing with malaria also.\u201d The study\u2019s authors argue that difficulty in reaching a hard number for confirmed cases should not preclude officials from working to address the real gaps in national public health monitoring systems. The study was the first to use systematic empirical data to estimate the burden and costs of dengue on India, and was led by researchers from Brandeis University, the INCLEN Trust International in Delhi, and the Indian Council of Medical Research\u2019s Centre for Research in Medical Entomology in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Their findings do shine light on the discrepancies that exist between confirmed and prospective cases of dengue. The Health Ministry seems to be taking the findings seriously. As Dr. Dhariwal said, \u201cWe are aware of the facts that the study puts forth, and are taking them into account.\u201d We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in"}

The only states with no confirmed cases are Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee, Alaska, and Hawaii.\nFlorida's first case involves a 10-year-old girl in Hillsborough County (the Tampa area) who is recovering, according to an Associated Press (AP) report today.\nEV-D68, previously uncommon in the United States, typically causes only cold-like symptoms, but in some children it can cause a severe illness that leaves them struggling to breathe.\nAlmost all the illnesses have been in children, many of whom have asthma or a history of wheezing. The virus is believed to spread via coughs, sneezes, and contact with contaminated surfaces.\nThe CDC says that four patients who died were infected with the virus, but the role it played in their deaths is unclear and still under investigation. Yesterday, however, health officials in New Jersey said the virus caused the death of a 4-year-old boy who died in his sleep.\nEV-D68 is also suspected of being a factor in a mysterious polio-like illness that has struck a number of children in several states, including at least 10 in Colorado. Four of the Colorado children, who had partial paralysis and limb weakness, tested positive for the virus.\nKeith Van Haren, MD, who has researched the polio-like cases in California, said he thinks EV-D68 will be identified as a factor in the cases, according to a Bloomberg News story today. \"As a member of the clinical community, I think it is just a matter of time before we establish a definitive link between EV-D68 and this polio-like illness that follows,\" he said.\n\u00a0\nStudy: India's dengue cases, costs greatly underestimated\nIndia's official disease burden from dengue woefully understates the actual situation, with true case numbers standing nearly 300 times higher than the officially reported ones, says a study yesterday in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The cost burden of the disease amounts to $1.1 billion per year in the country, the authors estimate.\nReported cases of dengue in India, the country thought to have the most such infections worldwide, averaged 20,474 annually from 2006 to 2012, says the study by US and Indian researchers. Using an adjustment factor arrived at through an empirical case study in the Madurai district in the state of Tamil Nadu as well as expert opinion and a retrospective study at 10 medical colleges across the country, the authors estimated the true annual number of cases at 5,778,406, which is 282 times the official number.\nTo estimate the direct medical cost of dengue in India, average costs for treating a hospitalized dengue patient and a patient seen in the ambulatory setting were multiplied by the proportion of the population thought to be treated in each of these settings (67% and 33%, respectively), resulting in a total of $548 million. When indirect costs such as lost wages and the costs of travel to and from treatment are added, the total economic burden is $1.1 billion, the authors say.\nMosquito-borne dengue is thought to infect from 50 to 390 million people worldwide each year from more than 100 countries, with 20,000 fatalities.\nThe authors conclude, \"With India's increasing role in international travel and the global economy, the need for additional dengue control and prevention strategies when available, such as vaccine and innovative vector control measures, becomes increasingly strong.\"\nOct 6 Am J Trop Med Hyg abstract\nIn other dengue news, BBC News reported today that the southern Chinese province of Guangdong is experiencing the worst dengue outbreak in 20 years, with more than 23,000 cases so far, 6 of them fatal.\nWet weather and high temperatures, with a fivefold increase in the mosquito population, are to blame, say Chinese officials. Also contributing to the increased caseload is the week-long China National Day holiday that is now wrapping up, during which 1,000 new infections have been occurring per day, says the story.\nWidespread pesticide spraying is being carried out, and free mosquito repellant is being offered.\nOther countries are experiencing increases in dengue as well, including Malaysia, with deaths from the disease tripling in 2014, and Japan, which is seeing its first outbreak in 70 years, BBC reports.\nOct 7 BBC News story\n\u00a0\nSaudi Arabia reports two more MERS cases\nSaudi Arabia reported two more MERS-CoV cases today, one of them fatal, extending a string of cases that began in late August after an early-summer hiatus in the virus's spread.\nThe Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a fatal case in a 51-year-old Saudi man in Hofuf who was not a healthcare worker. It said he had a preexisting illness and had been exposed to camels.\nThe other case involves a 77-year-old Saudi man in Taif, Mecca province, who has a preexisting disease and is in a hospital intensive care unit. He is not a health worker and was not exposed to animals, the MOH said.\nHis case is the eighth MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) illness reported in Taif since Sep 12. The previous patients included two health workers, whose illnesses were reported on Sep 22 and 28. Taif, a city of half a million, is about 62 miles southeast of Mecca.\nThe new cases raise Saudi Arabia's MERS tally to 759 cases, including 323 deaths. Nine patients are still under treatment, and 427 have recovered, according to the MOH.\nAlso today, the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (WHO EMRO) said no MERS cases have been reported so far in pilgrims participating in the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to holy sites in Saudi Arabia. The Hajj is now coming to an end.\nIn response to a Saudi MOH request, EMRO sent a four-member technical team to Mina, Saudi Arabia, to oversee MERS-CoV\u2013related precautions during the Hajj, according to the EMRO statement.\nOct 7 WHO EMRO statement on Hajj precautions\n\u00a0\nWHO notes declining Southern Hemisphere flu season\nThe Southern Hemisphere flu season is winding down, but influenza activity continues at high levels in Australia and Oceania, the WHO reported in its weekly update yesterday.\nInfluenza activity decreased in \"most countries\" in the Southern Hemisphere, the agency reported. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity decreased in South America and was mostly associated with respiratory syncytial virus. Flu activity is also low in Africa.\nIn Australia and New Caledonia, however, the flu season continued, with high activity associated with 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 viruses.

It also used a Delphi panel, a statistical tool comprising a structured group of experts, to arrive at an estimate of the correct number of clinically diagnosed cases.\nThe study puts the economic costs of dengue at $1.11 billion or $0.88 per capita and says that 80 per cent of the treatment expenses went to private centres. The study has been funded by Sanofi which, the authors said, was not involved in the process.\nAccording to Dr N K Arora, from the INCLEN trust, who is the corresponding author of the study, \u201cTo estimate the total disease burden, first we collected data from all government and private hospitals and nursing homes from a single district to arrive at an adjustment factor on the total number of cases. Based on national data, this factor was then extrapolated to the national level.\u201d\nAccording to Dr Arora, the main reason for this gross under reporting was the absence of private sector data.\nThe cost of a hospitalised episode in the public sector came to $197.03, and $ 248.11 in the private sector. For ambulatory or out patient treatment, the cost in the public sector was $ 23.49 and $ 26.09 in the private sector.\nSenior government officials said the study had also considered suspected dengue cases from the private sector. According to a senior official from the NVBDCP of the Ministry of Health, which supplied the national data for the study, \u201cThe study includes reporting from private hospitals, which primarily rely on rapid diagnostic tests. The kits have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. We consider them to be probable or suspected cases and not confirmed ones.\u201d\nExplaining that the government had not missed out on this data \u201centirely\u201d, the official explained, \u201cDuring this period, while our confirmed cases were over 22,000, the data on suspected cases was four-five times more.

Eight cases have been discharged, there are five cases are hospitalized. As at 0:00 on September 24 this year, the province reported a total of 7,497 cases of dengue fever cases, mainly in Guangzhou (6361 cases), Foshan (789 cases), Zhongshan (141 cases), Jiangmen (92 cases), Zhuhai (63 cases) Dongguan (15 cases).Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Zhuhai and Dongguan cities local epidemic outbreak cases. As the country's largest land port of Shenzhen, but this year more than ever dengue fever outbreak, \"calm\", Cheng Jinquan introduced, compared with the same period last year, only 13 cases over the same period this year, compared to 23 cases. But the concern is more local cases of the same period this year, the time local infections reported over a year earlier than last year. Currently the city appears two cases local cases, only one case last year; last time the first case of locally contracted dengue fever cases in late October of this year compared with last year reported more than one month earlier.Although less current dengue cases in Shenzhen, but the epidemic situation is still very serious.\u7a0b\u9526\u6cc9 said, according to the case in previous years, Shenzhen is the annual peak dengue 10-11 months, coupled with rain this year, Shenzhen particularly suitable for mosquito growth, high mosquito density. Thus, the epidemic peak of dengue may also occur in the future. Second, Southeast Asia and around the city is serious dengue epidemic, and Shenzhen exchanges and frequent these cities, the epidemic might spread to neighboring Shenzhen, in particular, the arrival of the National Day holiday, there may be cases of output, or the local epidemic outbreak. Finally, in Shenzhen Breteau index is still relatively high.Breteau index is to evaluate an area density of Aedes index, index of 5 or less, are safe range. Compared to last year, this year's Breteau index higher, \"Last August, Shenzhen Breteau index is 4, while the same period this year reached 7.63, higher than last year's 3.63.\" \u7a0b\u9526\u6cc9 said. At present, the Shenzhen district average Breteau index has reached 10.82, also more than last year's 7.51 high number. According to reports, Breteau index is high in areas outside the customs area of \u200b\u200bthe main raw in Pingshan, Longgang. Why is the number of reported dengue cases this year, Shenzhen significantly less, and has been a local outbreak of epidemic cases did not happen? In this regard, Cheng Jinquan analysis, there are four aspects of reasons, one is in Shenzhen in the health sector and urban AiWeiHui build defense mechanisms, in particular mosquito control gates installed in the city sewers, drains to prevent mosquito breeding. Second, once the outbreak occurs, it is promptly and AiWeiHui contact, in the seat of a large area of \u200b\u200bmosquito epidemic, the epidemic nipped in the bud.The third is to strengthen the monitoring work, especially Aedes density monitoring, timely reporting of data to monitor the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, \"Breteau\" index once more than five, disease control departments will notify the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee conducted disinfection and cleaning work , the Aedes density falls within the controllable range. Fourth, the health department conducts annual professional training, improve diagnosis and treatment and disposal capacity survey; and strive to achieve \"early discovery, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment, early disposal\"; disinfection technology to the whole of society organized professional training to improve professional level disinfection of medical institutions and agencies."}

The incidence of dengue came down this year compared to last year when 320 cases of dengue were reported in the corporation limit. The Trichy Corporation had reported 878 dengue cases in 2012.\nAlarmed by the high number of cases in 2012 and 2013, the corporation kick-started 'Information, Education and Communication' (IEC) activity as a part of the dengue prevention measures.\nThe previous records indicate that the incidence of dengue cases touched a new high from October to December and January. Hence, the corporation recruited 157 domestic breeding checkers (DBC) to eliminate the source of breeding of mosquitoes causing dengue. The elimination work had started in June.\nThe chances of domestic breeding of mosquitoes are high in areas under the Trichy Corporation due to the low awareness among the people about the cause of dengue fever.\nThe dengue mosquitoes breed from clean water. Despite awareness, people remained ignorant about the consequences of the fever.\nWhile slum-dwellers keep their surroundings conducive to mosquito breeding, people residing in apartments also contribute to breeding. Air-conditioners, refrigerators, flower vases, overhead tanks in residences were found to be the sources of mosquito breeding.\n\"The domestic breeding checkers have been posted in all the nine urban health posts in the corporation limit. They are assigned to conduct door-to-door visits in the areas allotted to them to check and eliminate the breeding source,\" city health officer Dr S Mariappan told TOI.\nAccording to statistics available with the corporation, a dengue case was reported in August this year while the number of cases reported in the corresponding month last year remained at 16. Besides the domestic breeding of mosquitoes, it was feared that dengue cases could be spread due to easy mobility of people from one place to another. \"Since the transportation becomes easy, the transmittance of diseases from one area to the other also becomes easier. So, a strict prevention measure should be in place,\" said Dr Mariappan.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

We are not expecting an outbreak yet, as so far this year's numbers are significantly less than last year.\"\nDoctors feel that while malaria is treatable, dengue can be deadly.

Moreover, this mosquito can cover an area of radius 200 metres,\" said Dr Rajesh Kumar, who works at a leading private hospital.

It is when a patient feels he/she has recovered that the platelet count starts to fall. The fever always returns on the seventh and eighth day. If not detected at an early state, it can cause death. No viral fever should be taken lightly.\"\nDr Satish Koul of Columbia Asia Hospital added, \"If fever continues for more than three days, along with body rashes and intense headache, make sure to consult a doctor immediately.\"\nDr Ashutosh Shukla of Artemis hospital advises people to observe a dry day, during which they empty and wipe all water storage vessels at home.

The out-patient department (OPD) has been witnessing about 10-15% rise in such patients.\"\n\"At least 10-15 patients with symptoms of dengue such as low platelet count, low blood pressure, high fever are admitted to the GMCH every day. Till date, all patients have recovered and have been discharged, with only about 10 undergoing treatment now. They are stable,\" said Borkar.\nShe also feared that since dengue is one of the most common infectious diseases, cases may increase in the coming days if proper precautions are not taken.\n\"We have been receiving quite a few cases of patients with dengue and malaria symptoms. When fever persists in a patient, we conduct a malaria test as a precautionary measure,\" said Anand Nikalje, medical superintendent at MIT Hospital.\nWhile both are vector-borne diseases, dengue is a viral disease and malaria is caused by a parasite. Mosquitoes that carry the diseases are different - the Aedes aegypti causes dengue, while the female Anopheles mosquito causes malaria.\n\"The two diseases are spread by different vectors, so technically a person can get both the diseases together. We need more fogging activities to control mosquitoes and maintain a hygienic environment,\" said Prabhakar Jirwankar, physician at GMCH.\nDoctors blame the rise in cases on the extended fluctuating weather conditions, accompanied by intermittent rains. \"This year, the outbreak of the diseases are being reported late, due to delayed monsoon. Though there is a marginal increase in dengue cases, by 5-10% in OPDs everyday, there is no cause for alarm yet. The cases are not too severe. People should not panic, but they should also not delay visiting a doctor,\" said Vivek Tadwalkar, head of medicine, Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital.\nTadwalkar said one can easily differentiate between viral and dengue fevers. \"The symptoms for viral infections include a running nose, throat pain, mild body ache and weakness. In dengue, a patient could have high fever, severe body ache, joint pain and rashes (pinkish in colour) all over the body within 24 to 48 hours of the fever and pain behind the eyes,\" he said.\nBeed district reports rise in dengue cases\nWith incessant rains in the district, the cases of viral fever and dengue suspects have gone up over the past one week. Citizens have been advised to follow a set of directives as prevention measures,\" said Gowardhan Doiphode, Beed district health officer.\n\"The mosquito-borne disease has gripped the city since the advent of the monsoon. There has also been a rise in cases of viral fever over the past few days,\" he said.\nPaediatrician Sanjay Janwale said that he is treating 25 patients suffering from dengue at present. Most of them are aged between three and five years. Though the condition of the patients is stable, one had suffered from dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), but recovered later.\nHe said patients with dengue-like symptoms are being reported in large numbers everyday from different places in Beed, like Gevrai, Shiur, Belapur, Nandur, Chinchwati, Patoda, Kolwadi, Nalwandi, Amla, Babultara, Pathi Ghat, Beed city and also from districts like Parbhani.\nJanwale warned dengue patients to be more cautious after recovery, since re-infections can result in serious complications and often prove to be fatal.\nViral fever is common with changes in the weather. \"Patients experience mild fever, fatigue, body ache and headache. On the contrary, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are less common but more severe,\" said Janwale.\n\"A patient affected with DSS suffers from low blood pressure, kidney and liver failure and respiratory failure as well. DHS initially presents itself with symptoms similar to regular dengue fever. The patient suffers bleeding because of a drop in platelet count and inability to clot blood. Percentage of mortality is more in such cases, but they are also rare,\" Janwale said.\nDoiphode said the department has stressed upon awareness on dengue and other vector-borne diseases. Awareness campaigns were carried out in blocks, towns and city pockets effectively. The health department has already stepped up its surveillance and stressed on cleanliness drives for the prevention of spread of diseases.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

He said notices had been issued against four building firms with a fine of Rs. 15,000 each for neglecting measures to prevent mosquiot breeding.\nNumbers differ\nA curious thing is that there is a difference in the number of malaria cases that is reported by the corporation and the District Malaria Office. While the corporation reported as many as 930 cases in October, the District Malaria Office pegs it at 438. District Malaria Officer Arun Kumar S.B. said the corporation also numbers results examination of blood smears and those subjected to what is known as Quantitative Buffy Coat Test. Most private laboratories resort to this test to detect malaria.\nThe reason offered is that blood smear test is the method accepted under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.\nMangaluru: Srinivas Kakkilaya, a doctor who has been actively involved in malaria prevention, has questioned the health authorities\u2019 decision to exclude positive cases of malaria detected using the Quantitative Buffy Coat Test in the overall statistics. Dr. Kakkilaya said the test had been followed by many private hospitals and laboratories and like the blood smear test, it is sensitive enough to detect malaria parasite. \u201cBy leaving out QBC the State is not getting the exact number of cases,\u201d he said.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

While the total number of malaria cases reported in Dakshina Kannada last year was 2,800, the number of cases reported this year is 6,800.

District Malaria Officer Dr Arun Kumar said that 82 malaria testing laboratories in Mangalore City Corporation limits that have identified by the health department, have been submitting reports on malaria cases. However, to a query by general physician Dr Srinivas Kakkillaya, who is also the member of Malaria Control Action Committee, he said no arrangement has been made so far to ensure the hospitals to submit report on death cases occurred due to malaria. Though 14 death cases due to malaria have been reported, there is no strong evidence to prove the same, he said.\nTaking an exception to this, Kakkillaya said that when there is no mechanism in place for the hospitals to report to the health department, how can the department even have information on the total number of death cases due to malaria. \u201cAccept the reality first and then plan the measures. In the recent case, a police officer\u2019s mother-in-law died of malaria on Friday,\u201d he said.\nVisits to construction sites\nIn the wake of increase in number of malaria cases in MCC limits, the DC directed the officials to carry out the inspection in construction sites in a rapid pace.\nMCC In-charge Commissioner Gokuldas Nayak who said that 272 construction sites have been identified in the city of which the officials have visited 128 buildings, where mosquito breeding was found in 69 sites. Action was taken to destroy mosquito breeding in 50 sites and notices have been issued to five building owners.\nFree test kits\nDistrict Malaria Control Officer Dr Arun Kumar said that free rapid diagnostic test kits and tablets for detecting and treating malaria patients was available with the health department.

CMHO Dr Vaskale said that the patients suffering from fever become fearful when their dengue test report comes positive or their platelets count in the blood decreases. While, there is no direct connection between the decrease in the number of platelets and the severity of the disease. No bleeding takes place till the count reaches 20,000 mark. The doctors said that there is no need to worry if the patient tests positive for dengue or shows dengue like symptoms. He advised the patients to get them checked on a regular basis if the symptoms of dengue show up. He said that the patient should take paracetamol and drink large quantity of water. He said that the dengue like other viral diseases heals up in 5-7 days automatically.

Lakshmikant Roy (24), a resident of the camp, who was admitted to the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Science (VIMS), Bellary, died after a prolonged fight against suspected dengue.\nLakshmikant\u2019s death and the increasing number of patients getting admitted to VIMS have created panic among the residents of the camps where Bangladeshi refugees have been living for the last 30 years following the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.\nWith three people from the camps admitted to hospital on Monday, the number of patients receiving medical treatment has gone up to 14.\nCamps no. 2, 4 and 5 have been the most affected in the last five years. \u201cDengue appears in these three camps for three months annually. However, it was the most evident in February 2012 when 29 of the 70 residents were diagnosed with the fever. All of them survived after being given intensive medication,\u201d said Anil Mandal, a resident of the camp. Even last month, 12 of the 30 patients from camp no. 2 were diagnosed with dengue. Seven of them recovered and returned home.\n\u2018Poor living conditions\u2019\nAccording to Prashen Raftan, president of the Jana Kalyana Samsthe, the problem is owing to scarcity of water and unhygienic living conditions. \u201cPeople stock drinking water for weeks as there is severe water crisis in the camps. The living space too has become insufficient as the population has grown to around 20,000,\u201d he said.\nNarayan, District Health and Family Welfare Officer, however, denied the allegation. \u201cWe have a fully functional primary health centre in one of the camps. Besides, we have, for the last five months, deployed a dedicated a team of health workers, led by a doctor, with all required infrastructure, including an ambulance. We have also taken up a special drive to clean water tanks and other areas where mosquitoes breed,\u201d he told The Hindu on Monday.\nAccording to Dr. Narayan, Raichur district, with 86 identified dengue cases since January 2014, is better off than many other districts that have reported over 300 dengue cases in the same period. \u201cOf the 86 cases, 70 are from these rehabilitation camps,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Not dengue\u2019\nHowever, State Health Director Geeta Nyamagouder said none of the deaths reported from the rehabilitation camps in Sindhanur taluk could be attributed to dengue.\nShe said blood samples of those suffering from fever had tested negative for dengue. \u201cWe have asked the district death audit committee to study the cause of deaths reported from the camps and submit a report,\u201d she said.\nStating that the disease was under control in the State, the director said people had been mistaking any type of fever to be dengue. Health Minister U.T. Khader told The Hindu he would visit the taluk on August 27 or August 28 to take stock of the situation in the camps.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

However, neither the taluk administration nor doctors have confirmed these cases as dengue deaths.\nDr Lakshminarayana Reddy, director of Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Science (VIMS) in Bellary, about 100 km from Sindhanur, where most patients from the taluk are being treated, said that 268 samples were collected from Raichur district between January and July this year. \"Of these, 61 tested positive. Of 64 samples collected from Sindhanur taluk alone, 12 were confirmed as dengue,\" he said.\nDenying the deaths due to dengue, taluk health officer Dr Nagaraj Patil told TOI that nine suspected dengue patients have been admitted in VIMS and only two of them tested positive. \"However, viral fever is on the rise over the past two weeks,\" he added.\nVolunteers working with victims tell a different story though. They say the health department and district administration have not even woken up to the issue and are yet to grasp the gravity of the situation.\nAshok Makhija, a businessman from Hyderabad, who is stationed in the taluk to help the villagers said it is an epidemic-like situation. The 55 year-old, who also does social work, reached Sindhanur on Friday night and was appalled to see the entire taluk having just one camp of government doctors taking blood samples.\n\"There is no testing facility nearby and the samples are taken to Bellary government hospital. It takes about three to four days for test reports to come. By then, either the patient is dead or critically ill. These doctors helplessly refer the patients to the Bellary hospital but the poor villagers have no money to travel. They choose to die rather than bear the cost of travelling 100 km and get treated,\" Ashok told TOI.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=dengue deaths\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

The school is run by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).\nThe students, from class I to class V, complained of nausea after consuming 'masala rice'. One girl, who vomited and was admitted in the intensive care unit of a private hospital, was shifted out of ICU in the evening while the other 12 have been kept under observation and will be discharged on Sunday.\nThe affected students include two each from class I and IV; one from class II; three from class III and five from class V. The girl who was admitted in the ICU has been identified as Ansari Misbah (8).

The serving of the midday meal began at 9 am. Initially, one girl vomited after consuming the rice and later some more complained of nausea. As a result, the teachers stopped serving the food and rushed the 13 students to the nearby private hospital. The girl who vomited was unwell a week before.\"\nUbale said that she visited the school and the hospital. \"I also sent a team of officials to the kitchen of ISKCON, which prepares meal for the school, to check for lapses, if any, while preparing the food. The officials of the food and drug administration have collected samples of the food. The report will come after 20 days.\"\nUbale said the school board will send show-cause notices to the school principal and ISKCON to know more about the incident and what steps they had taken to prevent such incidents. \"We expect their replies in three days. Action can only be taken after we know the findings of the FDA report,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, M M Patil, supervisor of ISKCON Food Relief Foundation, said, \"We supply midday meals to 35,000 students in 80 schools run by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. We provide the food around 9.30 am for schools operating in morning shift and around 2.20 pm for those operating in the afternoon.\"\nPatil said that every day fresh food is supplied. \"Today, we supplied masala rice which comprised rice, spices and vegetables. There was no complaint from other schools. We do not know how only a dozen students from one school had problems,\" he said.\nPatil said, \"We supplied the same food later to the schools operating in the afternoon shift too and they did not have any problem. We are awaiting the FDA report which will tell us if something was wrong with the food supplied by us.\"\nPatil stated that the ISKCON has a kitchen in a clean environment and they take hygiene very seriously. \"One vessel contains food for about 2,000 students. So, if there was any problem with the food, then a large number of children should have been affected. Our cooks taste the food after it is prepared to check the quality. Further, teachers in each school are served samples of the food before it is served to the students,\" Patil said.\nThe primary education department of the PCMC runs 136 schools. Most of them are Marathi medium schools with a few Urdu and English medium schools as well.

This year, surprisingly, we are seeing people infected with both these diseases. The numbers are few but this is something we have not seen earlier.\"\nWhile dengue is caused and transmitted by the bite of an Aedes mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses, malaria is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium that is spread by the female Anopheles mosquito.\n\"I have already seen 4-5 cases with the co-infection. Dengue is supportive treatment and for malaria, we give anti-malarial treatment. These patients are coming with much lower white blood cell count and platelet counts and longer fever durations,\" said Dr Bajan.\n1\n\n XXXXXX  Daily News & Analysis"}

The latest diagnosed cases are a hospital nurse, Namrata Gurav who was admitted on November 10, and a staffer, Shivalal, admitted on November 5. This is the third civic hospital after state tun JJ Hospital and KEM Hospital that reportedly has dengue breeding spots.\nThe civic body had located two breeding sites last month in the hospital that is spread across a seven-acre plot. One is in building number V, where class III and IV employees reside, and another in an under-construction building where accumulated water in the basement had become a breeding space for Aedes Agypti mosquito \u2014 the carrier of dengue. Both the sites have not been cleaned yet, staffers from MGM employee union said.\n\u201cI was admitted to the ICU after my platelet count dropped on October. I expected cleanliness at the hospital. But no steps have been taken,\u201d said Uttam Palaw, a hospital staffer.\nCasualty medical officer Dr Pravin Dhakite, who was discharged from hospital last week after dengue treatment, said, \u201cI live in the quarters in the hospital itself. Perhaps I contracted dengue from there.\u201d\nThe hospital has been under renovation since 2008. While four buildings stand under-constructed with water accumulating around the debris, a duct running through the hospital has been left open. The area behind the staff quarters where some take bath has also become a place for water collection,\u201d Deepak Gole of the MGM employees union said.\nEven as posters against mosquito breeding can be spotted on the walls at the hospital, Newsline found fresh water stagnated on a bathroom floor.\nFormer MLA Jaiprakash Chhajed on Thursday wrote to CM Devendra Fadnavis on the issue. \u201cThe hospital premises is not only breeding mosquitoes, it is also not running to its full capacity. It should be cleaned properly and a provision to transfer patients suffering from dengue must be made,\u201d Chhajed said.\nOn Thursday, only 74 of its 300 beds were occupied. Despite availability of beds, a staff nurse, Neha Redkar, had decided to shift her son to KEM hospital for dengue treatment due to non-availability of all facilities. She, too, was diagnosed with dengue last month.\nDr Gajanand Bhagat, hospital\u2019s medical superintendent, however, said, \u201cThe staffers should take care inside their residences. They do not drain water. The hospital is cleaned regularly.\u201d He said \u2018negligence\u2019 of staffers inside their houses has led to the dengue cases.\nThe civic health department has confirmed 10 dengue deaths in the city so far while another two are under investigations.

This is worrying the city's residents as well as healthcare officials. The question that arises is despite all kinds of facilities, manpower, resources and infrastructure at the disposal of the administration in the state capital, why has it not been able to check dengue that has claimed four lives in Bhopal in 2014?\n\nHT talked to some health experts and doctors to know the possible reasons for the surge in dengue cases in the city. Here are the top five reasons: \n\nShortage of water supply\nShortage of drinking water supply in the city compels people to store fresh water in containers, particularly in Kolar area. This allows dengue larvae to breed in fresh water. The larvae breeds in small openings, leaf axils, flower pots, discarded tyres, old oil drums, water pots and in water storage containers near human dwellings.\n\nLack of awareness\nThe level of awareness about dengue among people in Bhopal is poor. Not many know that its larvae breeds in fresh water or only the female mosquito transmits the dengue virus. This mosquito bites during the day and is most active in the hours after sunrise and before sunset. Despite some awareness drives by health authorities, there is resistance among people to take precautionary measures. \n\nMore case reported from Bhopal\nAccording to chief medical and health officer Bhopal, Dr Pankaj Shukla, more cases are reported in Bhopal as compared to other districts of MP. There are 17 places in MP where ELISA testing facility is available of which four are in Bhopal. \"We are reporting all cases, including the ones that come from other areas to Bhopal for treatment. So, the number of cases is higher here,\" he said. \n\nPoor sewerage network\nAs a result of poor sewerage network in Bhopal (only 32% of the city has a proper sewerage network), water stagnates in choked drains and outside them. The poor sanitation in many areas also provides space to mosquitoes to breed and multiply. The defective ground surfaces also lead to accumulation of stagnant water. Not allowing water to stagnate anywhere in the city remains a huge challenge. So, it is technically not possible to eliminate dengue completely.\n\nInflux of travellers\nBeing the capital of Madhya Pradesh, the influx of travellers or people who pass through the city, is higher as compared to other cities of MP. Dengue can easily enter into the city through infected travellers. According to health experts, migration or high mobility of people is also significantly contributing to the spread of dengue. The dengue mosquitoes' eggs are extremely hardy; they can survive for months without water, allowing them to be transported over large distances before hatching and infesting a new area.\n"}

This year dengue has claimed two lives in the state capital and affected 43 others.\nThough civic and health authorities are confident of containing the disease, experts say they're fogging over the real situation.\nAccording to estimates, BMC has just four big fogging machines to cater to 14 zones in the city. Of this, two machines are non-functional, civic officials admit. In a city with over 24 lakh population, experts say at least five fogging machines per ward is required to effectively control spread of vector-borne diseases.\nAs a result, BMC has to rely on 14 small machines provided for each of the 14 zones in the city. So to carry out any vector control operation in entire TT Nagar, parts of Arera Colony and areas in between, BMC effectively is left with just one fogging machine, said an expert.\n\"It is not a hidden fact BMC and health department put together are woefully short of staff and additional resources,\" he said.\nOn the other hand, district malaria office (DMO) has on paper eight fogging machines of which just two are functional. Moreover, health department has been sitting over DMOs request for purchase of 20 more fogging machines. Interestingly, first such application was shot down, two years ago, wherein authorities cited lack of any fresh dengue cases in the city.\nIn a recent meeting over vector control, health and BMC decided to share responsibilities, where BMC would carry out fogging along with cleanliness drive and DMO will pitch in wherever dengue or malaria is detected.\n\"The policy nearly reverses, pre-emptive controlling activities, which led to less than 30 cases in 2011 and 2012. Both teams have to be proactive, else dengue control is not possible,\" said a health officials, seeking anonymity.\nWhen asked about pre-emptive vector control activity this year, DMO officials cited issues including election duty. \"We act when dengue is found and our efforts are limited to our staff strength. We work on Sundays too,\" said district health officer, Dr KV Vajpai.

Also, Bhopal reported its first dengue death this week.\nThe unusual spurt in dengue fever is severely affecting residents of South TT Nagar and Arera Colony, according to DMO. \"Dengue is on the verge of turning into an epidemic due to lack of cooperation from residents in carrying out fogging and adopting anti-larval measures,\" said a DMO official.\n\"We have found larva in water storage tanks, water coolers and other household items. However, many households don't allow us to spray to kill larva,\" he added.\nOn being contacted, BMC commissioner Vishesh Garphale said, \"We would initiate strict action against households or commercial establishments where larva is detected. Lack of cooperation with BMC or DMO teams will not be taken lightly.\" However, BMC has not yet penalized anyone. According to health department, six new cases were reported in Chunna Bhatti, South TT Nagar, Arera Colony, Ishwar Nagar and JP hospital vicinity. Most of the victims were undergoing treatment in JP hospital and Red Cross hospital.\nExperts claim that unplanned and rapid urbanization along with inadequate waste management lead to gaps in public health infrastructure. The civic body has for long relied on fogging machines to control spread of vector-borne diseases which has a limited effect and it needs to impose fines to combat spread of the disease, said an IDSP official.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Anil Agre made the charge in a public interest litigation filed with the high court here through counsel Srikant Khandalkar. The petition alleges absolute apathy and inaction on part of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The civic body officially acknowledges only four deaths.\nMaharashtra health secretary, divisional commissioner, collector, commissioner of police and DCP (Traffic) in Nagpur, deans of Government Medical College (GMC) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC), NMC commissioner, and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's (MPCB) member secretary, have been made respondents in the case.\nA bench of justices Bhushan Gavai and Vinay Deshpande issued notices to all respondents asking them to file a reply within two weeks. Government pleader waived notices for the state. The judges declared that Agre's PIL would be heard with other connected cases. The petitioner contended that the city's government hospitals lacked facilities to detect dengue cases and poor people were ultimate sufferers as they could not afford costly treatment at private hospitals. He argued that a team of just 12 doctors was entrusted with the health of 30 lakh citizens, putting the lives of people at risk.\nThe petitioner said the disease spread like a wildfire and taken the form of an epidemic due to civic apathy. Agre pointed towards heaps of garbage lying all over the city as corporation had failed to discharge its duties despite charging taxes. He said even building material was dumped at most of the construction sites which indirectly helped in breeding of mosquitoes. Many times the garbage and construction material were dumped in nullahs blocking their flow and helping push up mosquito numbers.\nEven the abattoirs in many areas helped in increasing mosquito menace due to filthy surroundings and lack of hygiene. The NMC officials just sat idle instead of taking action against builders and erring citizens for dumping waste in nullah, he alleged. Charging the corporation officials with dereliction of duties, the petitioner said the NMC also lacked manpower and equipment to tackle the mosquito menace. He prayed for directives to the respondents to act on a war footing to check the epidemic.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=natural disaster,Nagpur Municipal Corporation,Maharashtra Pollution Control Board,Indira Gandhi,Counsel\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

As city reels under an outbreak of dreaded dengue, a surprising fact has emerged that all the cases have come from relatively better off areas of the city. \n\n\n\n As the suspected dengue cases shot up to 2,778 in the city, of which 293 were confirmed positive, not one was reported from any slum area. These are highest numbers on record. Results of another 382 suspected cases are awaited and that would undoubtedly push up the number of positive cases further. Till this year, the highest number of positive cases was 260 and 231 in 2013 and 2012 respectively. NMC records say four dengue deaths were registered this year which too is highest ever though health activists believe NMC has failed to record all deaths. \n\n\n\n \"NMC is doing its best to prevent the spread of dengue. Still 293 positive cases out of total 2,396 serum samples tested were registered between January 1 and October 31. The reason for posh and outer areas of the city getting affected is simple. Piling of garbage or unclean condition do not cause mosquito breeding. Instead they breed in stagnant water in water-coolers, flower pots, dog bath tubs etc found in well-to-do homes. Door-to-door survey of 4.88 lakh households revealed mosquito breeding sites in 20,977 of them. Most positive cases are from Laxmi Nagar and Dharampeth zones (West and South-West Nagpur) which are considered posh zones,\" said Ramesh Shingare, chairman of NMC health consultative committee. \n\n\n\n He claimed suspected dengue cases were on decline due to massive drives undertaken by NMC in the last six months. \"About 1,652 samples were received in October while only 382 were received in first 15 days of this month. The cases will now go on decreasing with falling temperature. Mosquitoes do not breed in cold conditions,\" he said. \n\n\n\n Asking private hospitals to stop creating panic among citizens, Shingare said the state government had issued a missive directing the hospitals not to go for transfusion unless platelet count dips to 20,000. \"Deputy director (health) Sanjay Jaiswal was present in today's review meeting and informed about the directions of the government,\" he said. \n\n\n\n Shingare also said mayor Pravin Datke was taking the issue seriously and holding reviews once in a week. Municipal commissioner Shyam Wardhane and deputy municipal commissioner Sanjay Kakade are getting daily updates of serum samples and household surveys. \n\n\n\n NMC malaria and filaria officer Jaishree Thote said mosquito breeding sites identified in households were destroyed to prevent spread of dengue. \"Inspection of 4,034 open plots was done and action taken on 3,196. Guppy fish were released in 339 of 730 wells having contaminated water. Training has been given to 11,000 students going to 105 schools,\" she said. \n\n\n\n On abandoned Sanchayani building at Khamla, Kakade said 900 metric tonnes of garbage and silt was removed from the complex. \"Notices were issued to the owners,\" she said. \n\n\n\n Shingare said NMC planned to set up own pathology lab for quick testing of samples. \"It is taking 15 days or more to get results from the government labs. NMC is not waiting for reports and going ahead with cleanliness drives around the premises where suspected cases have been reported. Construction of lab is expected to cost Rs 25-30 lakh and funds will be provided in next budget,\" he said."}

The court's observations came while hearing a PIL filed by Poonam Pride Condominium through its President SC Bera who highlighted the plight of residents around Sanchayani Complex at Khamla Square that had been turned into a dumping ground due to NMC apathy.\nOther respondents - State Pune-based Directorate of Public Health, NMC commissioner and Health Department, and Kanak Resources Management Ltd, were also issued notices and told to reply within a week. Co-owner of the under-constructed structure, Subhash Patil, who is the last respondent, was however not issued notice on the request of petitioner's counsel Deven Chauhan.\nChauhan argued that their apartment was located opposite to Sanchayani Complex which is an abandoned structure since many years and subsequently turned into a dumping ground. During rainy season, filthy water accumulates and remains stagnant there for a long period, providing ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. He pointed out that since last seven years, residents in its vicinity were witnessing daily dumping of all types of organic and inorganic waste in the basement and also in front of the complex and the footpath.\nThe petitioner had many times approached NMC for action while apprising the officials that the entire complex had also become a den for criminals and antisocial elements but all their pleas fell on deaf ears. The residents also tried to lodge a complaint at online grievance forum but their efforts were in vain.\nChavan attributed the rise in dengue cases to corporation's apathy on not cleaning abandoned structures like Sanchayani Complex. He pointed out that 736 cases were registered till September this year of which 136 were positive. In September alone, 543 suspected cases were registered. Chavan asked if city like Surat could be turned into cleanest city after plague hit it a few years back, why couldn't Nagpur. Justice Deshpande then orally observed they hoped NMC commissioner would follow Surat's example.\nThe petitioner prayed for directives to NMC health department and commissioner to ensure the relevant provisions of the MMC Act, 1949, relating to sanitation and public health, prohibiting accumulation of any filth, garbage or other pollutants in any premises, were scrupulously complied with. He also insisted on orders to the respondents to take measures for removing garbage, sludge and stagnant water accumulated at the complex with utmost urgency.\nWhat the petitioner said\n* Sanchayani Complex abandoned by builder midway, seven years back\n* It turned into a virtual dumping ground for organic and inorganic waste\n* During rainy season, filthy water accumulates on ground floor\n* Entire area turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes\n* All this led to big jump in dengue cases in that area\nWhat the HC did\n* Directs NMC deputy health officer Milind Ganvir to remain personally present\n* Tells NMC officials to submit entire data on dengue cases, including deaths\n* Asks respondents to read newspaper reports on new medicine on deadly disease\n* Expresses concern over heaps of garbage lying at many places including Gandhi Sagar\n* Points out severe shortage of blood platelets for dengue patients\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Subhash Patil,State Pune,President,Kanak Resources Management Ltd,Directorate of Public Health NMC\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

However, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is in a denial mode. In fact, dengue virus even killed at least ten patients (number known to TOI, the actual number could be much more).\nYet the corporation is not ready to accept either the sudden rise in positive cases in last two months or the number of deaths, as according to the corporation, the private hospitals treating dengue cases are not using 'Elisa' test, which according to it and WHO norms, is the only confirmatory test and hence these cases diagnosed through rapid test cannot be considered as dengue positive.\nNMC has record of just one death of a nine-and-half-year-old child from Deendayal Nagar in August out of the 35 persons who tested positive from 123 samples tested using Elisa. In September, out of 325 samples tested, only 28 turned positive and there are were no deaths in September. Besides, private hospitals, both Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMC) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) have had enough positive cases. IGGMC had 76 positive cases, while GMCH had about 190.\nWhether the fault lies with the NMC or with private hospitals is a secondary question. The reality remains that dengue virus is affecting a large population from all age groups, unlike few years back when it only affected children. This is also causing many deaths. In Nagpur division, covering six districts (excluding Nagpur city), dengue has caused 16 deaths since January this year out of the 394 positive cases from 45 outbreaks.\n\"Though the number of dengue deaths has drastically fallen over last four years, it continues to be a cause of concern. We need to educate people about measures needed to prevent the dengue virus carrier (the Aedes aegypti mosquito) as it breeds in fresh water,\" said the assistant director of Malaria and Filaria in the deputy director of health services department.\nWhile NMC continues to blame private hospitals for not reporting the actual dengue cases in the right format and sending serum samples for conducting Elisa test to NMC, the hospitals in turn feel the process is impractical, cumbersome and unnecessary. \"Mostly dengue or dengue-like patient reaches a hospital in critical condition with very high fever and low platelet count. At that time even doing the NS1 antigen test using a rapid assay is enough indication to begin the treatment. The corporation report comes in a week to ten days. Are you expected to wait for the report? In fact, the patient generally even gets discharged before the report comes,\" said the general manager, administration of a big private hospital.\nNMC's Malaria and Filaria officer Dr Jayhshri Thote says, \"Unless the hospitals inform about the positive cases and send serum samples for confirmation, NMC cannot take preventive measures in areas where the patient belongs to. It is mandatory for them to report and send samples,\" she said.\nThe increase in dengue cases, especially in September, is being supported even by blood banks. Dr Sheela Mundhada of Jeevan Jyoti blood bank and Dr Harish Warbhe of Lifeline blood bank told TOI that the demand for platelets (a blood components responsible for causing clotting) has increased manifold in last fortnight. They have appealed to people to donate platelets in nearest blood banks.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=World Health Organization,Jayhshri Thote,Indira Gandhi Government Medical College,Harish Warbhe,Government Medical College\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Also, it is found that many private hospitals are declare dengue cases as positive, and also starting treatment. This practice creates panic and should be avoided,\" he said.\nWardhane directed NMC officials to initiate action against open plots, cattle sheds that have stagnant water or are unclean, and also launch drive to identify and destroy mosquito breeding spots. \"NMC health department should spread awareness among citizens by means of advertisement and inspections. Also, information and data should be made available on YouTube. Citizens should select one day and observe complete dry day,\" he said.\nStressing cooperation from citizens is a must to prevent vector-borne diseases, Thote said mosquito breeding is possible even with very less stagnant water, like in abandoned paint buckets, flower pots etc. \"Mosquito breeding spots have to be traced in localities from where suspected dengue and malaria cases come in. Citizens should ensure there is no stagnant water and cleanliness is maintained within and outside residences.

From 1,986 cases of gastroenteritis in July, the cases have dipped to 1,042 last month, according to data from the civic health department.\nDr Anil Ballani, general physician at Hinduja hospital, said, \u201cGenerally gastroenteritis cases are very high during the onset of monsoons. With the sudden change in temperature and weather, the conditions lead to stomach infections. But when the rain settles, the cases come down automatically.\u201d\nApart from relatively low cases of gastroenteritis, the cases of typhoid (140), leptospirosis (22), and fever (7,305) recorded in civic hospitals and dispensaries in August were also under control, deputy executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said.\nHowever, one case of H1N1 was reported in August, with a 35-year-old female patient admitted in private-run Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital for treatment in the last week of August.\nSo far this year, a suspected death due to dengue has been reported in Nair hospital in which a 34-year-old male from Malad died on August 4. However, according to Ballani, this year the treatment of dengue, which claimed 12 lives in the city last year according to the civic body, has been better.\n\u201cPeople are more aware about dengue. The hospitalisation and detection of the disease is taking place faster, which is providing a greater chance in curing the patients,\u201d Ballani said.\nExperts also said that rainfall has been comparatively less, which has helped curb the disease. So far this year, the civic body has held over 36 monsoon camps for screening people for various diseases.\nGomare said, \u201cLast year we had over seven camps every Sunday. This year, the count has been less because of less rain. We also started holding the camps late in July, while last year the camps had begun in June.\u201d\nmumbai.newsline@expressindia.com\n\n XXXXXX  Indian Express"}

This startling fact has been highlighted in Godrej Kala Hit\u2019s new TVC titled \u2018Bhagao Nahi, Maro\u2019. The campaign has been conceptualised by Lowe Lintas and is built around the core idea of \u2018Kill it before it kills you\u2019.\nWhat makes dengue more lethal is that it spreads very rapidly in urban areas and its symptoms are difficult to diagnose. It is a debilitating disease, which often leads to hospitalisation and in extreme cases, death. The fact that there is no vaccine yet for the disease makes it even more dreadful.\nThe TVC features two families who meet over tea after a long time. One of the families go on and on about their son who does nothing but kill mosquitoes, sitting all day at home. The family talks nothing about its other son who is a Senior Manager. The TVC is funny, but sends across a strong message that \u2018Dengue ke machchar ko marne se bada koi kaam nahi\u2019 (there\u2019s no bigger job than killing dengue mosquitoes).\nArun Iyer\nElaborating on the concept, Arun Iyer, National Creative Director, Lowe Lintas, said, \u201cIn order to make people aware about this new and unique dengue mosquito, our starting point was people\u2019s casual attitude towards mosquitoes and how we could alter it. We decided to flip this casual attitude on its head and came up with the idea \u2018Dengue ke machchar ko marne se bada koi kaam nahi\u2019.\u00a0We thus dramatised \u2018killing mosquitoes\u2019 as the most glorious job ever.\u201d\nAjay Dang, VP \u2013 Marketing, Godrej Consumer Products, said, \u201cSuccessful campaigns to fight diseases across the globe have one thing in common \u2013 a powerful and simple message and a direct call to action. HIT\u2019s fight against dengue mosquito stems from this very philosophy. The simple message of \u2018Bhagao Nahi, Maaro\u2019, and the call to action of using the most efficacious mosquito solution, Godrej Kala Hit, is the best.\u201d\nThe campaign went live on August 18, and is being aired across major entertainment, news and sports channels in India.

Dengue cases, like most monsoon ailments, have seen a spurt in July as the rains gained momentum.\nThe victim, with a history of alcohol abuse, was admitted to the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central on Sunday. Doctors said he was brought in a very critical condition. His platelet count had dropped dangerously following which he suffered hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where the brain loses its function due to liver failure. \"The patient had slipped in a comatose condition induced by the dengue fever. The patient was also suffering from lower respiratory tract infection,\" said a doctor from the hospital.\nThe civic authorities confirmed that the patient had tested positive in the rapid test, which is not considered confirmatory. \"The patient had multiple comorbidities, including a history of alcoholism,\" said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC epidemiologist. \"We have been unable to trace the victim's address, so we are yet to find out if he was a permanent Mumbai resident, as well as do contact tracing,\" said Gomare. Malwani had emerged as a massive hotbed of dengue last year when scores of cases and at least two deaths were reported from there.\nDengue cases in July had nearly doubled, when compared with June, that saw scanty rainfall and thereby less infections. Gomare said the situation was better than last July, when 66 cases were reported. Over a dozen deaths were reported last year. City physicians maintained that dengue and malaria have been under control this monsoon. Malaria cases in July (848) have shown a marginal increase, compared to June (566).\nDoctors said citizens have to be more alert about leptospirosis that has claimed two lives. Intensivist Dr Khushrav Bhajan said he treated two patients who had a serious life scare. \"One was a 22-year-old girl, who needed ventilator support after she came with very low BP and urine output,\" he said. He added that in most cases patients were showing an involvement of the kidneys, liver and lungs. \"Lung involvement though is rare in leptospirosis,\" said Bhajan, who consults with PD Hinduja Hospital, Mahim. He said the infection was easily treatable with simple antibiotics, with the key being right diagnosis.\nThe BMC recorded 1,986 cases of gastroenteritis, 117 of typhoid and 176 of hepatitis in July.

It used data drawn from BMC's health department to show a huge disparity between the number of deaths the civic body attributes to diseases and the reasons given on death certificates.\nFor instance, BMC health data for 2013 showed that tuberculosis had claimed 1,393 people and malaria had killed 30. \"But RTI data reveals that according to the death certificates issued by the BMC 7,127 died due to TB and 199 due to malaria during the same period,\" said the foundation's Milind Mhaske.\nThe NGO's 'State of Health of Mumbai' report showed that TB and hypertension were among the leading causes of death in the financial year 2013-14 in Mumbai. Of the 87,027 Mumbaikars who died in 2013-14, 7,075 died due to tuberculosis and another 4,525 due to complications arising out of hypertension.\n\"Almost 9% died due to TB. This figure has been almost constant for the last few years,\" said Nitai Mehta of Praja Foundation. \"Mumbai is set to become the TB death capital of the world.\"\nThe other 'killer' diseases include malaria (195), dengue (108) and diabetes (2,341), revealing how Mumbai is at the receiving end of both communicable as well as non-communicable diseases.\n\"Data drawn from BMC hospitals and dispensaries using RTI showed that malaria case fatality rate remains high, with one death due to malaria out of every 94 who are diagnosed in 2013-14,\" said the Praja press release. In the three years to 2013-14, dengue deaths rose from 52 to 108. While 1.2 lakh citizens suffered from diarrhoea and 255 died of it in 2013-14, seven died due to cholera and 10 due to typhoid.\n\"People are dying due to diseases such TB, malaria, typhoid, etc. that are easily treatable. Among the factors are inadequate health infrastructure and shortage of health staff,\" said Mhaske. The report analysed BMC's death certificates on various parameters and said the city had registered 7,650 \"unnecessary deaths\".\nMeanwhile, the BMC held that Praja's method of checking health department data and death certificates is improper. \"Death certificates are written by treating doctors who look at past history and their clinical impression to write out the cause of death. Our data on death is based on diagnostic reports,\" said an official.\nA senior BMC doctor said discrepancy in TB deaths is possible because many Mumbaikars depend on the private sector for treatment. \"The Union government-run TB programme only records deaths of patients who take free medicines from it. Deaths of TB patients who took treatment from the private sector are hence not maintained in the government list,\" the doctor said.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=TB,Praja Foundation,Milind Mhaske,malaria,BMC\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Among cities, Greater Mumbai reported 162 cases followed by Thane (54) and Pune (34) cities. The state has registered a total of 1,100 dengue cases till June end this year. Of them, 784 cases are from small towns and villages. \n\n\n\n The number of dengue cases has jumped from 824 (between January and June last year) to 1,100 cases registered during the same period this year. However, the number of deaths has dipped with just four deaths this year as compared to 23 deaths during the same period last year. \n\n\n\n State health officials attributed the rise in patients to rapid urbanisation and shortage of water in state's rural parts which prompts people to store water. \"Most dengue cases have so far been from villages and small towns because of unplanned growth and construction activities every where,\" said Kanchan Jagtap, joint director, Directorate of Health Services. \n\n\n\n In rural areas, the state has a team of 12,000 multipurpose workers who make door-to-door visits and take stock of the situation every fortnight. \"As many as 25 sentinel centres for diagnosis of dengue are functioning in the state. It is also one of the reasons why more cases are detected now,\" Jagtap said. \n\n\n\n Jagtap met civil surgeons, district health officers and district malaria officers recently to take stock of the situation. He suggested a multi-pronged approach to check dengue in rural parts of the state. \"The focus is now on straightening outbreak response, capacity building among medical professionals and the public, information, education and communication and working out a strategy to improve inter-sectoral coordination, monitoring and supervising of the reduction of mosquitoes breeding spots,\" Jagtap said. \n\n\n\n The Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) recently carried out a pilot age-stratified, cross-sectional dengue prevalence study in collaboration with Vadu Rural Health Programme of KEM Hospital, Pune. Dengue prevalence was determined in two villages that have different levels of urbanisation and population density. A significantly higher seropositivity of 58.5% for dengue virus was found in the urbanised village, compared with 41.2% for the rural village. \n\n\n\n \"Dengue virus is moving towards rural areas and this is likely to increase the magnitude of the disease in the near future. The reason being rapid urbanisation of small towns in rural Maharashtra,\" said senior scientist Devendra Mourya. \n\n\n\n Besides, rural people have inadequate knowledge about dengue fever and its vector. \"Villagers practise preventive measures which are inadequate. Television and other mass media tools can play an important role in conveying health information to the public,\" said internal medicine expert Abhijit Joshi of Joshi Hospital. \n\n\n\n Climatic conditions favourable for dengue, water scarcity leading to increased storage of water, increasing construction activity, piling up of garbage, lack of public awareness about personal anti-mosquito measures and inadequate mosquito management have aggravated the situation, say experts."}

At the slow rate of reduction in child deaths and stagnation in urban cities like Mumbai, that seems like a far cry.\u00a0 The increase in child deaths between 1-5 age group has done little to nudge the government into action.

But Maharashtra has not been included in feasibility studies,\u201d said a senior Union Health Ministry official. Doctors suggest additional vaccines, even though expensive, should be introduced. \u201cA long-term study to see if pneumococcal vaccines will work against local pneumonia virus strains has been under way for two years. These vaccines cost between Rs 200 and Rs 3,200 and their efficacy should be studied,\u201d said Dr Mamta Mangalani, head, department of paediatrics, BMC-run Sion Hospital."}

It's under reported because of the weird nature of the disease. Malaria is not picked up in the first two blood samples. This leads to such patients landing in hospitals with lung, heart, liver problems.\" Dr Bhajan, who right now has 2-3 malaria patients in the ICU, said though these people had initially tested negative for malaria, they were responding to anti-malarial treatment. \"Doctors have to be vigilant as it looks like the parasite has undergone some kind of a mutation,\" said Dr Bhajan. BMC's health department, however, feels otherwise. Dr Mangala Gomare, epidemiology department in-charge in BMC, said: \"Mumbai sees malaria cases throughout the year. The numbers during this period of the year has been the same, with no rise or dip. We have round-the-year programmes to fight malaria. Our efforts have been appreciated even by the central government. We now aim to restrict malaria cases to the minimum and require Mumbaikars' cooperation for this.\" BMC also plans to concentrate on containing dengue this year, as it was a cause of worry last year. \"Extra efforts are being taken to implement intervention programmes at workplace as most dengue mosquito breeding spots are found in non-slum areas,\" said Dr Gomare. What is malaria? Malaria is a serious disease which is fatal at times, and is caused by a parasite. Malarial patients are generally very sick with high fever, shaking chills and flu-like illness. Four kinds of malaria parasites can infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. You can prevent malaria by Keeping mosquitoes from biting you, especially at night; eliminating mosquito-breeding places around your home; spraying insecticides on your home walls to kill adult mosquitoes that come inside; sleeping under bed nets, especially effective if they have been treated with insecticide, and wearing insect repellents and long-sleeved clothing if out of doors at night."}

While the 43,676 cases were registered last year, the number was 1.39 lakh in 2010.\nWith the department identifying Mumbai, Gadchiroli, Thane and Raigad as key pockets with most number of malaria cases, the focus this World Malaria Day (April 25) is to create awareness about the need to complete the entire course of treatment.\nAccording to Dr V N Khanande, Joint Director of Health, there have been 6,377 cases of malaria and three deaths since January this year. He said a number of programmes had been organised to encourage inter-personal communication and the need to complete the entire course of treatment for malaria.\nState entomologist Dr Narendra Jagtap said there had been a sizeable drop in the number of malaria cases. \u201cIn 2010, there were as many as 1.39 lakh cases with 200 deaths. Last year, we registered 43,676 cases with 88 deaths. Mumbai had over 10,000 cases of malaria while Thane had 6,802 cases. Pune, in comparison, had 214 cases of malaria last year in rural areas,\u201d he said.\nAt Pune Municipal Corporation too, Assistant Health Officer Dr Vaishali Jadhav said the number of malaria cases in PMC area had dropped from 137 in 2010 to 47 in 2013. \u201cA meeting with the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme officials has focused on how low cost treatment was available and simple solutions need to be utilised to prevent the disease, such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets and malaria prevention during pregnancy. Moreover, health workers visit at least 5 lakh homes every month as part of the active surveillance to detect fever cases,\u201d she said.\nThis year\u2019s theme is \u2018Defeat malaria\u2019 and the health department has issued a series of posters and other information education and communication material to be distributed at villages, railway stations and bus stands. In high risk areas like Mumbai and other districts, Jagtap said, a systematic process of issuing health cards to construction workers and migrants, so that they could be tracked, had been introduced."}

Up to three cases of malaria related deaths have been suspected to have occurred since January this year, said civic health officials. &quot;We are suspecting deaths due to malaria and the cases are being investigated by the death inquiry committee constituted by the municipal corporation,&quot; said Dr Mangala Gomare, epidemiologist, public health department, BMC.  The city has seen 1,600 cases of malaria since January this year, with three suspected deaths. According to the civic officials, last year saw nearly 10,000 cases &ndash; a welcome decline from 79,000 cases in 2010. Since January, doctors observed sporadic cases of malaria involving high grade fever, headache, dehydration and fatigue.  &quot;In 2013, we had recorded lesser cases of malaria as compared to previous years but we must not get complacent,&quot; said Dr Arun Bamne, executive health officer, BMC. Nearly 30 people fell victim to malaria last year.  Experts have noted a disturbing trend with dengue cases being reported throughout the year. Earlier, the virus was found to be breeding only during the monsoon. So far, this year 78 cases have been recorded. Dengue had claimed 11 lives last year.  Dipali Chakor, 26, a south Mumbai resident, was afflicted to painful dengue disease, two weeks ago. She survived after putting up a tough fight. &quot;I had developed fever and rashes on my body for five days after which I consulted a doctor. I was admitted in the hospital for at least a week before showing any signs of recovery. I used to record fever as high 105 degree fahrenheit,&quot; said Dipali.  Dr Pratit Samdani, Dipali&#39;s consulting physician at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, said that she had come with high grade fever, swollen face, boils and red rashes across her body. &quot;Her blood tests for dengue tested positive. Apart from a stark dip in platelet count, her liver was majorly swollen. She was suffering from dengue hepatitis and showed a major involvement of effect to the liver,&quot; said Dr Samdani.  &quot;With no specific treatment, nearly 20% of dengue cases become complicated. The Aedes aegypti mosquito breeds indoors in man-made containers, flower pots, trays etc.,&quot; said Dr Mangala Gomare, epidemiologist, BMC.  Experts say that the bugs have become stronger than the drugs since the past few years. Mosquito-borne viruses are developing resistance to insecticides and undergoing deadly mutations. &quot;Climate change, environmental temperatures, humidity are allowing insects to breed in places they did not breed before,&quot; said Dr Dhanashree Kelkar, consultant, infectious diseases at privately-run Global Hospitals, Parel.  &quot;Earlier, dengue used to subside after four to five months of monsoon. But, the mosquito as well as the virus have adapted to climate change. The bug has become stronger than the drugs and is also mutating to adapt favourably to climate change. Otherwise there is no way that a mosquito or virus could have bred in such hot weather in Mumbai. But we are still recording sporadic cases and the situation will only get worse in monsoon,&quot; said Dr Samdani.

One of the lawyers of Salim Khan told TOI that his client was not able to attend the court on health ground, as he is presently suffering from malaria. Three of the four witnesses summoned by the Judicial Magistrate's Court First Class arrived today to give their testimony in this over 15 year old case. The former assistant conservator of forests (ACF) S A Momin, and two wildlife activists Debi Goenka and Manish Moghe were seen at the court premises to appear as witnesses and give their accounts of the raid which had taken place on October 15, 1998, at the Panvel based `Arpita Farmhouse', owned by Salim Khan. The fourth witness, the then deputy conservator of forests (DCF), R K Das, has reportedly not responded to the court summons today. \"In 1998, I had gone along with the forest officials to raid the Panvel based farmhouse from where we had found protected wildlife animals. A long time has passed since that raid took place and an FIR was subsequently lodged against Salim Khan and one caretaker of the farmhouse under the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972. So, I am here to give my statement in front of the judge now,'' said the environmentalist and wildlife activist, Debi Goenka.

XXXXXX  The writer has posted comments on this article   Breeding Fish To Fight Malaria   Minor initiatives taken by the ward office have helped reduce malaria cases   by nearly 13%, compared to 2012. While 165 cases of malaria were detected from June to December 2012, the number came down to 145 in the same period in 2013. Ward officer S Dhonde said the breeding of guppy fish was increased and they were released in stagnant water puddles, which are mosquito-breeding sites. \"We are breeding guppies in two ponds to control growth of mosquito larvae. Currently, we release these fish in drains and other water bodies at four major locations in the ward,\" said Girish More from the civic body's pest control department. One of the areas where the fish are released is Dahisar River, as residents of housing societies by the river-turned-nullah complain of mosquito infestation. Restoration Of Shiva Shrine   Mandapeshwar Caves, a rock-cut shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, was built around 1,600 years ago. The temple, now a ruin, is in the care of the Archaeological Survey of India. There are a few relief panels, including one depicting Shiva as Nataraja. Jitendra Nath, superintending archaeologist from the Mumbai circle of the ASI, said restoration of the caves will be carried out in phases. \"We are currently restoring the walls on the outer surface of the caves. There are three chambers in the caves, which will be taken up for restoration at a later stage. The cave temple is open for public,\" said Nath. The open space outside the cave is under dispute and is currently being used by children from neighbouring areas like Shivaji Nagar. Waste Segregation Project Revived   An NGO, Voice of IC Colony, had initiated a project in August 2011 to segregate dry and wet waste from daily garbage collection. The group not only met residents in the colony to spread awareness on the issue, it also trained the sweepers and garbage collectors in the area in solid waste management. \"We had distributed pamphlets listing the dos and don'ts of garbage disposal, and also put up posters across the neighbourhood. We met residents of five to six housing societies in groups and trained them. It was quite a success,\" said Diana Dias, an IC Colony resident. However, in the last eight months, the practice was discontinued as the civic body failed to get the vehicle contract for disposal of dry garbage, said Dias. With the contract now in place, the residents plan to revive the project in the next few months, after training more citizens and other stakeholders. Bollywood's Scenic River, Now Known As A Nullah   Dahisar river, which originates at the spillway of Tulsi Lake in Sanjay Gandhi National Park, is now reduced to a huge nullah. The river was once known for its idyllic and beautiful surroundings. Several Hindi films in the 40s and 50s were shot here, the last one being in the late 1970s. Datta Rane (79), a Dahisar resident since the 1940s, said a number of films, from Ek Din Ka Sultan (1945), directed by Sohrab Modi, to Swami (1977) directed by Basu Chatterji, were shot there. \"Most of Dahisar in the early 40s and 50s was a hillock. In those days, local residents would swim in this river. It was a nice spot for recreation, even foreigners loved swimming here. Whenever there were film shoots, the whole place was decorated beautifully. Things have changed a lot after urbanisation,\" said Rane. He added that the Dahisar bridge, which is now lying in ruins, was the only way to cross the river. Indira Bhende, another resident whose family lived in Dahisar for over six decades, said the Girish Karnad and Shabana Azmi-starrer Swami was one of the last films shot at Dahisar river. Today, the river has lost all trace of its glory and is reduced to a mere nullah, a dumping ground for waste and construction debris.

Doctors also believe that adequate fumigation is not being done, especially in areas prone to mosquito breeding.\nGeneral physician, Dr Farah Ingle, who consults at MGM Hospital and Fortis Hospital in Vashi, said that 25 confirmed cases have been reported every week at both hospitals since October. \"Unlike previous years, severity of the cases is extremely high this time. Patients have been coming in with low platelet count, liver and kidney failure and bleeding.

Talking about a recent case wherein a patient was diagnosed with dengue while he continued with his daily routine, Dr Sodi said, \"The patient was taking normal medicine and did not feel even one symptom of dengue.

So far, over 300 cases of the mosquito borne disease have been reported in the city.\nAt TMC\u2019s Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital, Kalwa, doctors have registered 209 dengue cases, of which one patient has succumbed to the disease. Medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Rajeev Korde, said, \u201cDengue can be fatal. Compared to last year, we have certainly seen a rise in the number of cases.\u201d\nThe Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) will deploy 100 health officials, who will go door-to-door to inspect possible mosquito breeding grounds. These officials will also make announcements to educate people about the ways to protect themselves from dengue.\nDr Ram Kendre, health department, TMC, said, \u201cThe fluctuation in weather conditions are partially responsible for the rise in the number of dengue cases. For mosquitoes, this is an ideal weather to breed, resulting in a spike in the number of patients suffering from dengue.\n\u201cEvery month, we generally see around four dengue cases. We are even treating an eight-month-old baby for the disease. We have lost three patients in the past six months,\u201d said Dr VS Mishra of Lifeline Hospital, Thane.\nDr Deepak Ahire, who practices at a private hospital echoes the sentiment, as he says, \u201cEvery month, out of five suspected dengue patients, at least two test positive.\u201d\n\n XXXXXX  I am in dna of India"}

While one of the girls was admitted to the hospital on Monday, the other was diagnosed with dengue for the second time in a month. These cases have led to concern among parents regarding the hygiene conditions on the school premises. Mother of the student who was diagnosed with dengue said, \"The school premises might look clean but the toilets here are very dirty. Many students here do not like to drink water from the school's water cooler claiming the water is not clean. My daughter had told me that one of her classmates had dengue and on the same evening, I found her burning up with fever. We first thought it was a viral fever. But her blood reports came back positive for dengue.\"\nThe girl's doctor Asit Choksi said, \"Though the symptoms are not of haemorrhagic dengue, the child is suffering from dengue fever. Thankfully it was diagnosed before it got worse.\" Meanwhile, Principal of Asia School Scaria Thomas insisted that extreme care was taken to keep every nook and cranny of the school clean. He said, \"We never compromise with cleanliness on the school premises. The kids don't spend all their time in school. It is possible that children might have contracted the fever at some other place.\"\nKIDS SUSCEPTIBLE TO DENGUE\nDoctors say there has been a spike in number of students diagnosed with dengue post-Diwali. Dr Amit Gupta, a child specialist who has treated more than thirty cases of dengue in past two months, said, \"Post-Diwali, I have observed a sudden rise in number of kids contracting dengue. I had more than thirty cases of kids suffering from dengue in past two months.\" Elaborating on the symptoms of dengue in children, he said, \"It starts with fever, vomiting and decreased appetite. Dengue can be detected in one to two days with the help of two tests. We advise parents to keep the children hydrated and rested.\"\nAccording to doctors, children are more susceptible to dengue fever. \"Dengue-spreading mosquitoes bite in the day. Children spend most of the day in school. So possibilities are that they might contract the fever at school,\" a doctor said. Stressing on the need to keep school premises clean, Dr Choksi said, \"It is vital for schools to keep the environment clean and fumigate the school campus and toilets regularly. Water tanks should also be cleaned regularly.\"\nSchools have also started making efforts to make their campus denguefree. Pragya Pandya, principal of St Kabir School on Drive-In Road, said, \"The school campus is fumigated every alternate day. The housekeeping staff ensures that the entire campus is cleaned regularly there is no mosquito- breeding on campus.\" Dr Tarulata Hirani, Executive Director of Ahmedabad International School, said, \"We have got fogging machine in the school. We have been actively working to curb the dengue by regularly fumigating the school campus every Saturday.\"\n'NO COMPLAINTS FROM SCHOOL'\nWhile doctors might be concerned about spike in dengue cases among children, AMC said that they are yet to receive dengue complaints from school. In-charge Medical Officer of Health Bhavin Solanki told Mirror, \"We have indeed received complaints regarding rising number of dengue cases. But we have not received complaints of dengue cases from any city school except Asia. Also, we have also been carrying out exercise at various areas to control breeding of Aedes Aegypti (the vector which carries virus).\"\nHowever, Solanki claimed that the AMC team had inspected Asia School campus on Saturday and had found no mosquito-breeding or stagnant water there. Health report card issued by AMC on Monday suggested that there is a surge in number of dengue cases registered in month of November. While 105 dengue cases were registered in month of November 2013, civic body has registered 258 cases till November 22 this year. The total number dengue cases have reached 700.\nJAUNDICE CASES ALSO ON RISE\nThe report states that AMC has also registered a surge in number of jaundice cases in November, compared to last year. There were 269 registered cases of jaundice in November 2013 while this year, the cases have gone up to 307, stated the health report. In 2014, total 3,625 cases of jaundice have been reported till November 22.\n\n XXXXXX  Ahmedabad Mirror"}

No preventive medications was applicable. We were sure about the cause of death and therefore analysed the blood samples of the patient, which further confirmed our doubts,\" said an official of the private hospital.\nThe hospital has sent the report to the district health administration. This will be submitted to the state health department for further confirmation. The district health administration has intensified its effort to contain the disease and has started a disease surveillance programme.\n\"We are keeping a tab on every viral fever case from the rural parts of Kolhapur district.

After confirming the dengue cases, the health department has started preparations to contain the infection.\nHealth officials said that pre-monsoon showers a fortnight back had triggered the breeding of mosquitoes causing the deadly disease. \"We have received the reports of both the infected patients. We have sent our teams to their houses and the localities to search for mosquito breeding grounds, which will be destroyed. The pre-monsoon showers caused water-logging at many places and helped mosquitoes breed. Blood samples of other members of their families and those living in the area will be taken to look for any other dengue patients,\" said Udaykumar Bhat, head of Infectious Disease Control Department of the KMC.\nThe dengue-carrying mosquito, the Aedes, breeds primarily in man-made containers like earthenware jars, metal drums and concrete cisterns used for domestic water storage, as well as discarded plastic food containers, used automobile tyres and other items that act as receptacles of rainwater.\nThe disease is caused through the bite of the mosquito infected with any one of the four dengue viruses. Dengue symptoms range from a mild fever to incapacitating high fever, with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a prime cause of serious illness and death among children.\nThe civic administration will conduct an intensive survey of breeding spots in the coming days and will appeal builders to destroy breeding sites. The Bombay Provincial and Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, empowers the civic administration to file cases against those responsible for creating nuisance such as throwing garbage and littering. The civic body can impose penalties in the interest of public health.\n\"Last year, we found breeding sites mainly at ongoing construction sites. However, builders have hardly felt the need to clear up sites. This year, after the survey, we are going to appeal builders to free construction sites of such mosquito breeding spots, or will initiate action according the act,\" Bhat said.\nOut of the five deaths due to dengue in 2013, four victims were from the Sambhajinagar area. The civic administration has started clearing garbage and cleaning nullahs in the area on a war footing. It will undertake campaigns to sensitize residents about preventing the dengue. Constant surveillance and spraying insecticides have been started across various parts of the city.\n\"Citizens should ensure cleanliness at their homes and premises, as most of the times, breeding sites are found inside the patient's house. Utensils should be kept dry and spraying insecticides regularly will decrease the chances of infection. Patients with even mild fever should refer a physician and undertake prescribed tests for early detection of dengue,\" said Sudhesh Gandham, associate professor of preventive health care at RCSM Medical College.\nIn dengue patients, organs like the kidney and liver stops functioning. The normal count of platelets is 1.5 lakh to 4.5 lakh per microlitre of blood. In viral fever, this is reduced up to 90,000 to one lakh.

There has been a three-fold rise in the number of dengue cases in the last two years. Last year, 232 persons were infected as against 68 in 2012. Altogether 113 cases of dengue were reported in 2010. The district health department organized a campaign in 2011, which helped to reduce the number to 12. In 2013, six persons died due to dengue and seven in the preceding year. More than 415 people were infected by dengue in the last four years, whereas the number of patients infected with chikungunya and malaria during the same period stood at 108 and 547, respectively. District malaria officer G M Gambre admitted that there has been an alarming rise in the number of dengue cases over the last two years. \"We are taking precautions and spreading message among people to take preventive measures to stop the spread of disease.\" The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main vector that transmits the viruses that cause dengue. The viruses are passed on to humans through the bites of an infective female aedes mosquito, which mainly acquires the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person. These mosquitoes breed in clean water, often stored in overhead tanks or accumulated in scrap tubes and tyres of vehicles for more than a week. Dengue infection rates are higher outdoors and during daytime, when these mosquitoes bite most frequently. The medical fraternity attributed the rise in the number of patients to the lack of personal hygiene among people and governments failure to provide basic amenities of proper drainage system and safe drinking water. President of the Kolhapur Medical Association (KMA)Anand Kamat said, \"The rise in the vector-borne diseases is due to inefficiency of government in providing safe drinking water and proper management of sewage and drainage.\" \"Vector-borne diseases spread through organisms that act as carriers of the parasites and pathogens causing the ailment. The most common ailments are malaria and dengue,\" he said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that the environmental changes in the world are leading to an increase in the breeding of vectors and is a cause of concern for the spread of vector-borne diseases across the globe. Medical practitioner Jayant Watve said, \"People do not realise the importance of personal hygiene until they fall ill. The spurt in vector-borne diseases is seen during rainy season. The lack of sanitation and access of safe drinking water are major problems in the district especially during the rainy season.\" He added that patients are advised to keep their surrounding clean and dry. They are also told to avoid storing water in open utensils and consult a doctor immediately in case of fever and muscle and joint pain. The district health department will be organising a door-to-door health campaign for a fortnight from April 7-21. The programme will be a part of the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) with the slogan 'small creatures, big threat'. \"District health department employees will visit villages to create awareness about methods to prevent vector-borne diseases,\" said Gambre.

The leaflets are presently available in English, Hindi and Marathi.\n\n \n\n The state government has started the process of renovating the Candolim PHC. Lobo said that the old PHC will be demolished and a new hospital with modern facilities will be built.

Officials of the district health department said that they are geared to take necessary measures to control the spread of the disease.\nMore dengue cases have been reported from urban areas, rather than rural areas, in October. An official from the district medical office said that the highest number of cases have been reported in the month of October for this year. \"About 66 blood samples were collected from rural areas, of which 19 tested positive. On the other hand, 121 samples were tested from the Nashik Municipal Coporation (NMC) areas, from which 68 turned out to be positive,\" the official said.\nFrom January to October, 86 positive cases were registered in the NMC jurisdiction. A total of 88 cases across the district have been tested positive for October.\nUnder the ZP jurisdiction, as many as 144 suspected cases were reported, of which 49 had tested positive and six deaths were registered since January 2014. In Nashik district as a whole, seven persons had succumbed to dengue so far this year. One of them was from Nashik city.\nBesides carrying out surveys at houses, the health departments of the NMC and ZP have appealed to people not to store water.\nDistrict epidemiologist Uday Barve said that the chain of breeding of mosquitoes has to be broken. \"Many rural areas of the district like Malegaon, Ranjangaon, Yeola, Nandgaon and Sinnar face water scarcity and residents tend to store water, since they receive water once in two days. This makes for an ideal situation for mosquito breeding,\" Barve said. Besides, populations tend to migrate due to the festive season, allowing the disease to spread from the city to rural areas and vice-versa.\nFrom January, about 92 samples have tested positive from 318 blood samples from rural areas, while 86 have tested positive out of the 219 samples from areas under the civic body. One case had tested positive from the Malegaon civic body jurisdiction.\nA death, suspected due to dengue, was also reported on October 23 from Malegaon.

Ideally the health department conducts raids on the spots from where samples have been confirmed. It educates everyone about reporting any incidents of fever. It also offers free basic treatment to the people diagnosed with fever in the surrounding locality. Because of lack potable water supply, people tend to store water.\u00a0 The health department is also supposed to empty vessels, sometimes forcefully, as they could be the possible breeding ground for malarial and dengue mosquitoes.\nIncrease in Malarial and Dengue cases in the absence of monsoon is a definite sign of worry as the number might increase during monsoon. Lack of awareness campaign by VVMC only adds to the problem as people tend to ignore the fever.

However, the report from the director of health services, Aurangabad division, refused to buy the claim.\nAs per the health services report, the Aurangabad rural pocket recorded 12 positive dengue cases in July and August 2013, while the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) registered 10 cases. In 2014, the rural areas reported 42 dengue patients, while AMC reported 95 dengue positive cases in July and August.\nThe actual figures are more alarming as many cases go unreported in the city. \"Despite dengue being a notifiable disease many private practitioners fail to report the case,\" said Sandhya Taklikar, health officer in the AMC.\nWhile commenting on the increase in death toll, which has touched 10 in three months, she said, \"The government health department does not notify about private tests as they do not authenticate the disease. We believe in only the reports produced by the microbiology department of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).\"\nArchana Rane, medical officer at the AMC, said, \"Though the figures show that there has been an alarming rise in the number of dengue cases this month, many are reported from outside the city. Patients from nearby villages come to Aurangabad for treatment and they are reported as citizens of Aurangabad.\"\n\"However, we are taking precautions and spreading awareness among people to take preventive measures to stop the spread of the disease. The health department has intensified fogging, spraying and Abate treatment and has covered about 3,500 houses in two months to tackle the outbreak of any epidemic during monsoon,\" said Rane.\n\"Though the disease has not yet taken the shape of an epidemic, the situation may take an ugly turn if health authorities fail to initiate steps,\" said Indian Medical Association (IMA), Aurangabad chapter secretary Kuldeepsing Raul.\nHe, however, advised patients and their attendants not to panic. \"But one needs to remain watchful and must consult doctors if there is high fever and severe back pain,\" he added.\nIntensivist and medical superintendent at MIT hospital, Anand Nikalje, opined that the strain of the virus attacking the patients did not seem to be lethal and could be well managed. He, however, said that the secondary infection ought to be avoided as in that case the patients might sink into dengue shock syndrome, which is a dangerous condition.\n\"We are not taking any chance. If patients report strong dengue symptoms, we admit them for observation,\" he said.\nHead of GMCH medicine department, Mangala Borkar, advised that if the symptoms continue for a couple of days, then the patients should go for a thorough investigation to rule out dengue infection.\n\"Normally, we don't advise hospital admission unless patients report serious symptoms like persistent high fever, acute headache and pain in the backbone,\" she said.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Dengue cases,Aurangabad Municipal Corporation\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Unlike last year, the total number of dengue cases detected so far is extremely low. Experts suggest that this is due to scanty rainfall this year. According to the doctors of microbiology department of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM,), nine cases were detected in the month of July, while on August 8, patients got their dengue test confirmed. The test, ELISA, needed for confirming the disease is done only in the medical college.\n\"Last year, the number of dengue cases soared to nearly 250 during this period, however presently the situation is under control. The main reason behind this is insufficient rainfall. Dengue and chikungunya are caused by the larva of aedis egyptii mosquito which breeds in fresh water. If this mosquito bites a person affected by dengue or chikungunya, then the virus enters the mosquito and is further transmitted to a healthy person through this mosquito,\" Dr Atul Garg of GSVM microbiology department, said.\nGarg said that though the condition is currently under control, people should completely empty the drums and other containers used to store water, once a week, as a precautionary measure. \"Rise in humidity and change of weather is the favorable period for mosquito larva to grow. I would suggest that people should take measures to avoid stagnation of water in their localities.

The reported incidence of encephalopathy and encephalitis has been found to vary between 0.5% and 6.2%. But the death of a 40-year-old man, who developed dengue encephalopathy (brain inflammation), has brought the focus back on the changing clinical profile of dengue, which has, of late, started manifesting neurological complications more frequently. Among the cases of dengue encephalopathy, the incidence of intracranial bleeding is very less.\n\"Earlier, we thought that encephalopathy in a dengue patient was either because of kidney or liver failure and hypoxia due to lung injury. Now, we (doctors) should also keep a very high index of suspicion for the possibility of direct intrusion of virus into the central nervous system causing encephalopathy and subsequent intracranial bleeding in rare but fatal cases. We doubt that the virus is likely to have undergone mutation leading to change in its clinical presentation,\" said critical care expert Girish Date of the Sahyadri Hospital.\nDate further said, \"The victim's blood platelet count was 40,000 which is not low enough to cause bleeding. Thus we thought that this bleed is related to coagulopathy or vasculopathy which are blood vessel disorders caused by invasion of virus in cerebral tissue. The victim's condition deteriorated fast and he died within five days of admission. So, we could not carry out test of cerebro-spinal fluid to rule out the presence of dengue virus in CSF.\"\nThe victim was admitted to Sahyadri Hospital in Deccan on November 2. He complained of fever, chills and body ache and was initially admitted to a neighbourhood hospital where investigations showed he was dengue NS1 positive and showed mild drop in blood platelet count. His condition deteriorated later following which he was moved to the Deccan branch of Sahyadri Hospital.\nNeurosurgeon Charudutt Apte, head of Sahyadri Specialty Hospitals, said, \"Abnormally low amount of platelets (thrombocytopenia), blood vessel disorder and platelet dysfunction can explain the intracranial hemorrhagic complications in dengue infection. The degree of very low platelet count correlates with the clinical severity of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Thus, impairment of platelet function can increase the risk of vascular fragility (decrease in the resistance of blood vessel walls) leading to brain hemorrhage.\"\nApte says that high index of suspicion in dengue is required especially in those patients who are disoriented and have altered sensorium.\n\"It should not be misinterpreted as fever delirium or toxic encephalopathy. It needs immediate attention and investigation. Timely diagnosis and intervention can thus save many precious lives. In countries endemic to dengue like India, it will be prudent to investigate for dengue infection in patients with fever and acute neurological manifestations. There is a need for understanding of the pathogenesis of various neurological manifestations in dengue,\" Apte said.\nSenior scientist Mandeep Chadha, deputy director of National Institute of Virology, said, \"The condition is rare. We should look for dengue in case there is hemorrhage as well as encephalopathy. However, doctors should not think that all encephalitis casea are due to dengue as this would send a wrong message among patients.\"\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Experts said that the dip in temperature has brought down the cases, but expressed concern that the recent untimely rain may cause a resurgence a week from now.\n\"Only one or two new cases of dengue are being diagnosed every day. On Saturday, a lone case was recorded. A total 20 cases have been recorded in the last seven days. The winter chill certainly has a role in reducing the number. The aedes mosquito, which causes the disease, goes into hibernation when temperature dips,\" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).\nThe city has reported 62 cases of dengue so far in December. \"An average six to eight cases were recorded at the beginning of this month. The number has gone down in the last few days, which is a good sign. The winter has set in and temperature is expected to fall further, which will reduce dengue infection cases,\" said another civic health official.\nHowever, entomology experts say that dengue cases might see an upward swing a week from now. \"The city has just witnessed a heavy spell of untimely rain, which may have caused water stagnation and accumulation in discarded plastic items and tyres. These conditions are conducive to mosquito-breeding. There are chances of a rise in dengue cases after eight to 10 days, which is the time it takes for a mosquito egg to turn into an adult mosquito in fresh and steady water.\"\nThe PMC has appealed to citizens to stay vigilant and clear stagnated water from their residential premises. \"The rain will not have an impact on mosquito-breeding if citizens keep their surroundings clean by not allowing rain water to accumulate. There is more awareness among people now and we expect they will do their bit to add to our regular surveillance and destruction of mosquito-breeding sites,\" said another civic health official.\nThe spread of dengue infection was at its peak in September and October. Of the 1,920 samples of suspected dengue cases that the National Institute of Virology received in these two months, mainly from Pune and adjoining districts, 1,250 were found infected with dengue virus. These accounted for 65% of the total samples received - the highest registered in the last 10 months.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Officials, however, claim that the number of cases has gone down significantly in the last few days.\n\"The surveillance work to identify and destroy breeding spots has been intensified. We have destroyed a total of 13,917 mosquito breeding spots so far. Our health staff has been working relentlessly without a holiday for a long period,\" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).\nPeople can also do their bit by ensuring that their surroundings are clean and there is no mosquito breeding in and around their residential premises, he added.\nThe number of dengue cases has increased significantly since July, with more cases being reported from Warje, Hadapsar and core areas like Kothrud, Tilak Road, Karvenagar and Aundh.\nSanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer and head of the insect control department at the PMC said that about 90% diagnosed with dengue in the city had vector-breeding spots inside their homes. It is routine for the civic staff to visit the houses and surroundings of patients to avoid spread of the infection.\nHealth staff found Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in uncovered water barrels, flower pot plates and terrace areas. They also found larvae places like elevator ducts, lotus ponds, defrost trays of refrigerators, money plants and parking lots.\nHealth officials said that since the dengue mosquito breeds in fresh water, it is imperative for every household to observe 'dry day' once a week, when all utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned. \"Items that can store water like plastic containers or used tyres should be covered or properly discarded. Flower vases should be emptied and cleaned at least once a week,\" Wavare said.\nHealth staff also advised people to repair leaking pipes and outdoor taps, and clear unwanted scrap around housing societies/ bungalows. \"Keeping refrigerator drawers dry, punching holes in the bottom of tins before placing them in the garbage, properly covering trash containers, drums, barrels, tanks, buckets and any other containers where water can accumulate are some of the best prevention tips,\" he added.\nThe only method to control or prevent dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes. \"Proper solid waste disposal and improved water storage practices, including covering containers to prevent access to egg-laying mosquitoes, should be followed,\" Wavare said\nThe PMC health officials have been collecting fine from housing societies for not clearing mosquito breeding sites. They have also filed criminal cases against builders, independent bungalow-owners and housing societies. The cases have been filed under Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, scheduled chapter 17, rule no 15 and scheduled chapter 19, which empowers the civic administration to initiate action in the interest of public health.\nThe sections of the BPMC Act 1949, under which the cases have been filed, cover all kinds of public nuisance like throwing garbage and littering, for which the court has also imposed penalties. The civic body has started invoking these sections in cases regarding mosquito breeding sites.\nDengue: Key facts\n* Modern life styles are very suitable for mosquitoes. The high density of human population, a protective environment with well-controlled temperature and humidity is tailor-made for mosquito breeding.\n* The higher the density of mosquitoes, in close proximity to human habitation, the better the transmission of dengue virus\n* The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a day biter with a very short flight, gets disturbed by the host and needs to probe on multiple hosts to complete its blood meal.\n* The increase in residential buildings and inadequate and intermittent water supply compels people to store increasing amounts of water which then offers a haven for this mosquito to breed\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity have an effect on the Aedes mosquito, which goes into hibernation when the temperature falls. The favourable condition for mosquito breeding is when the humidity level is at 60% with an atmospheric temperature between 21 and 23 degrees celsius. However, apart from dengue, cases of malaria and chikungunya are also being reported.\nSanjeev Wavare, head of the insect control department at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) confirmed that the dengue cases have gone down, \"The rain will not have an impact on mosquito breeding if the citizens keep their surroundings clean by not allowing rain water to accumulate and stagnate.

In fact, NIV had recorded only 495 positive dengue cases in the first eight months of the year, but the figure jumped to 1,745 in the last two months.\nScientists at NIV said that all the four serotypes of dengue virus were in co-circulation during this period. \"During the month of September, we received 725 blood samples of suspected dengue cases.

While corporators blame substandard insecticides used by the health staff, entomologists have asked the PMC to rule out chances that the mosquitoes have developed resistance to some of the drug molecules in the purchased insecticides and larvicides.\n\"I have raised the issue of the quality of insecticides even in the general body meeting. The insecticides are of poor quality and not at all effective. The uncontrolled outbreak of dengue for more than two months clearly shows that substandard insecticides are being used,\" said Vijay Deshmukh, a Shiv Sena corporator from Hadapsar.\nHadapsar has reported a large number of dengue cases. \"Every lane in Hadapsar has one or two cases of dengue.\nThe larvicides used by the health staff have failed to destroy mosquito breeding spots,\" he added.\nSharing this view, corporator Bala Shedge said, that the health staff identifies around 30 to 40 mosquito breeding spots every day, but the medicines or larvicides they use do not yield results. \"Had they been using effective larvicides, the number of cases would not have escalated. Every locality in Pune has one or two dengue cases. The city is under threat. We are going to pursue the matter further with the municipal commissioner. If the medicines are not useful then they should be replaced immediately,\" he said.\nExperts, meanwhile, have urged the civic body to do a resistance check. \"PMC needs to find out which drugs the mosquitoes are susceptible to and to which they have developed resistance,\" said an entomologist.\nThe purchase of insecticides at the PMC has long been mired in controversy. In 2011-12, the state audit department had found fault with the civic body's purchase of insecticide worth over Rs 1.6 crore - the PMC failed to follow prescribed norms, including getting the samples tested to ascertain their quality and efficacy.\n\"The audit report released by the state audit department had highlighted that the insecticides purchased in 2011-12 and used for preventing mosquito breeding were not even tested for their quality and efficacy at the government-designated labs, which is a mandatory process,\" said a civic health official requesting anonymity.\nAccording to the report, the payments were made to the agency for anti-mosquito medicines \"without the same being tested at government labs\".\nWhen contacted, S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), PMC said, \"We have tested the insecticides at designated laboratories and they were found effective. We have the lab reports with us.\"\nThe commonly-used insecticides to fight vector-borne diseases are Abate (a dengue larvicide), Glysophet (which is sprayed on water hyacinth to prevent mosquito breeding), Pyrethrum (used for fogging), and Cifluthrin, Bifenthrin and Solpac powder used for indoor spraying.

In June, 34%, i.e. 123 of the 361 samples, had tested positive.\nThe spurt has prompted the NIV to advise people to destroy indoor breeding sites of mosquitoes.\nControl of mosquitoes has been a long standing problem and has not been solved even by countries with better infrastructure. Officials said every house/school/office/factory or any unit for that matter, should make an effort to see that there are no discarded tires, plastic bags, containers, broken plastic ware in the vicinity where water can accumulate.\n\"People should maintain their coolers, air conditioner drains, basements, elevator shafts, water storage tanks and drums free of mosquitoes.

However, nearly a week after PMC gave a deadline of 15 days to declare the city free of dengue and malaria, residents of Kasba Peth have been complaining that no fumigation has taken place in their locality, quashing the civic body's claim of fumigating the entire city to eradicate the disease.\nDespite fewer deaths being recorded this year, areas like Sadashiv Peth, Vadgaon Budruk and Sahakarnagar have seen an alarming rise in cases, according to a survey by state health officers. Similarly, Kasba Peth is also a densely populated area.\n\"We have repeatedly complained to the PMC about this but to no avail. Four people are suffering from dengue in our our locality,\" said Rijwan Patel, a resident of Kasba Peth.\nAdding to the woes is the adjoining Nagzira Nala. A cement concrete trench where water gets accumulated runs parallel to the nala. \"There is an increase in mosquitoes immediately after rains. Repeated complaints have not yielded any results, forcing us to hold a rally to create awareness amongst the residents. Despite that, another person contracted dengue, and still the area hasn't been fumigated,\" said Patel.\nA resident of the area, Rohit Kadam, is admitted at Inlaks Budhrani hospital in Koregaon Park. His platelet count has fallen to 10,000 while a normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 350,000. Speaking to Mirror, his mother, Shaila Kadam, said, \"PMC workers have come twice for enquiries but no insecticide has been sprayed. All our efforts have been falling flat. A lot of places have accumulated water. There is a urinal in front of our house behind which water keeps accumulating. Adding to this, we have a well close by.\"\nWhen contacted, Head of PMC's insect control department Dr Sanjeev Wavare, however, said that this was unlikely and that PMC responds within 72 hours of complaints. \"We are taking a lot of measures. They must not have met the right people.\"\nJM ROAD MCDONALD'S FINED\nPMC has slapped around 2,200 notices to various housing colonies, corporate offices, government offices, hotels and bunglows, with the latest being McDonald's on JM Road.\nTwo days ago, McDonald's was served a notice and fined Rs 3,000. \"The basement, which is used for parking, had accumulated water which made it a potential mosquito-breeding site,\" said Suryakant Devkar, Medical Officer, Ghole Road ward.\nWhen Mirror contacted McDonald's, Ranjit Paliath, Vice President, Business Operations, released a statement which said that the water accumulation in the basement parking was not due to the McDonald's restaurant but because of the drainage system of the society where the restaurant was located. The restaurant had a separate drainage line. According to him, the management had earlier lodged complaints with the Health department regarding the issue and the eatery was pumping water out on behalf of the entire society. \"PMC has served a notice and levied the fine to all occupants of the society, including us,\" he added.\nAs per by-laws, it is the responsibility of individuals or institutions to keep the surroundings free of mosquitoes. \"We do not see who the entity is while slapping a notice targeting potential breeding sites. We do not care if it is a government office or hotels. We have registers at every ward office where at least 100 to 125 complaints regarding accumulation of water is noted everyday,\" said Dr Sanjeev Wavare, head of PMC's insect control department.\nGALLERIES\n\n XXXXXX  Pune Mirror"}

XXXXXX Discarded coconut shells filled with stagnant water can be a breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes.\nWritten by Anuradha Mascarenhas | Pune | Posted: September 21, 2014 2:59 am\nThree has been a sharp rise in the demand for platelets to treat dengue and most blood banks in the city are exhausting the stock collected by organising blood donation camps on the same day.\n\u201cThe demand for platelets is huge,\u201d said Dr Snehal Mujumdar, incharge of the blood bank at Ruby Hall Clinic.\nHis view was echoed at practically all the other blood banks in the city, with the medical fraternity also urging the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to clean up the city and ensure better sanitation.\nThe dengue-causing mosquito aedes aegypti breeds in fresh water and can be found in water pools, flower pots, water dripping from air conditioners, water collected in open containers among others. With over 2,300 suspected dengue cases this year \u2013 more than 1,000 registered between July and September itself \u2013 hospitals are packed to capacity while blood banks are organising daily blood donation camps to ensure that dengue patients get platelets.\nWhile\u00a0 a majority of\u00a0 dengue patients can be treated at home by administering them substantial fluids and other medicines, the severely ill are admitted to hospitals after a drastic fall in the platelet count. At Sahyadri Hospital, Dr Poornima Rao, incharge of the blood bank, said they were making as many as 100-150 random donor platelets (RDP), which get consumed immediately. According to Mujumdar, as many as 3-4 single donor platelets (SDP) were being processed daily \u2013 one SDP is equivalent to 8 RDPs.\nUntil recently, the only way to collect enough platelets for a single transfusion was to take blood donations from five to 10 donors, separate platelets from other blood cells, and combine them to obtain a large quantity for transfusion. Now, a sophisticated machine \u2013 blood cell separators \u2013 can collect enough platelets for transfusion from a single donor. The new process, apheresis, takes more time than the entire blood donation process but the percentage of platelets collected is more, said blood bank officials.\nDr Atul Kulkarni, incharge of Jan Kalyan blood bank, said that in the past week, every day at least 5 -6 SDPs were being processed apart from 50 RDPs. Presently, we have stock but the increasing demand means more voluntary blood donation camps, he said. At Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, blood bank officials said that as many as 350 RDPs and 25 SDPs were issued to treat dengue and cancer cases.\nDr S T Pardeshi, acting chief medical officer, Pune Municipal Corporation, admitted there has been a rise in dengue cases and breeding sites are being identified in the parking zone and terraces of societies, where water tends to collect and stagnate.\n\u201cWe have urged people to ensure there is no collection of water and now have no choice but to levy fines. More than 1400 notices have been issued and fines worth Rs continued\u2026\n\n XXXXXX  Indian Express"}

(Source: Express photo)\nWritten by Anuradha Mascarenhas | Pune | Posted: September 12, 2014 2:18 am\nWith 2,007 cases of suspected dengue fever being registered in Pune since January this year, measures taken by the the Pune Municipal Corporation\u2019s health department seem to have clearly failed to control the spread of the disease. State health officials have now called a meeting of medical officers to take stock of the situation. On the other hand, the PMC is struggling to fill 300-odd vacant posts at its insect control department.\nThe civic administration is yet to forward the draft bylaws approved by the general body last year to the state government. The bylaws allow the civic body to impose a fine of Rs 1,000 on citizens in case mosquito breeding sites are found on their premises. At present, action is being taken against construction sites and other properties as per the BPMC Act. When contacted, Dr S T Pardeshi, acting chief medical officer of health, PMC, admitted that there was a delay in sending the draft bylaws to the state government for approval.\nAccording to the draft bylaws, it is the responsibility of the individual or the institution using a property to keep it free of mosquito-breeding sites. More than 700 notices have been issued to construction sites and other properties but no action has been initiated against households where the majority of mosquito-breeding spots were detected. \u201cWe will be sending the bylaws for approval soon,\u201d Pardeshi said.\nMeanwhile, at least 300 of the 650 posts at the insect control department are vacant. These include those of senior and junior field workers. \u201cWe have invited tenders and 10 posts are being filled each week,\u201d said Pardeshi, adding: \u201cWe are taking action against properties where mosquito-breeding spots have been found.\u201d\nHe said surveys by the PMC had found 90 per cent of the breeding spots at homes. \u201cManagement of water at households is crucial during this time pf the year. We have urged residents to drain out the stagnant water as these can be mosquito-breeding sites, but people fail to do so,\u201d Pardeshi said.\nIn Pimpri-Chinchwad, health officials checked a total of 3.54 lakh containers at homes between June and September and found dengue mosquitoes in 2,208 of them. A total of 19 notices have been issued to construction sites. Dr K Anil Roy, medical officer of health, said 2.5 lakh pamphlets had been distributed to create awareness about dengue.\nDr Kanchan Jagtap, Joint Director of Health, said not all fever cases were checked in the laboratory and as per the surveillance data a total of 2,392 dengue cases had been confirmed across the state. The state has seen 15 deaths, including three in Pune continued\u2026\n\n XXXXXX  Indian Express"}

With the death of Nana Peth resident Khalid Shaikh to dengue infection on Friday, a week after 26-year-old Vishal Korpade who had become the first victim of the disease, the health officials have asked people to be alert.\nThe death report points to a serious situation looming before the health officials. Factors like rising numbers indicated by hospital reports of dengue positive cases reported to civic authorities and nearly a third of every sample sent to National Institute testing positive for the deadly infection are a cause of concern. The water scarcity situation resulting in water cuts is leading to storage of water, which is another factor in rise of dengue cases.\n\"Both heavy rains as well as scarcity of rains is a challenge as both can lead to spread of dengue. In heavy rains, we see temporary breeding spots getting created while in water scarcity, people store water which leads to breeding of Aedis aegypti mosquito that causes dengue. While it is true that dengue cases are increasingly being reported in the city, we do anticipate an increase in this season said Pradeep Awate, state epidemiologist adding that compared to last year, in 2014 both mortality as well as cases are less in number.\n\"The bigger challenge is spreading public awareness and making people realise the importance of ensuring there are no breeding spots around them. Unlike malaria mosquito which stagnates in dirty water, dengue mosquito breeds in clean water which means breeding spots in homes. Also people need to go to a doctor in time as most often we see that people report to a doctor late which leads to complications,\" said Dr S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health, PMC.\nIn the death reported on Friday, PMC officials observed that while symptoms of the illness like fever with chills, vomiting, loose motions started by June 30 but Shaikh didn't seek medical advice until July 2 from a local general practitioner. By July 3, his symptoms worsened and he was referred to Inlaks Budhrani Hospital where he was admitted and moved to intensive care where he died of dengue shock syndrome, within six hours of his dengue test coming positive.\nAdvising people not to lose time in seeking medical advice, assistant medical officer of health Dr Vaishali Jadhav said that the first few days after onset of symptoms are crucial.\n\nAedes aegypti, the mosquito which spreads dengue breeds in fresh water.\n\nPrecautions to be taken:\n\n    Observe one day in a week as 'dry day', when all utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned.\n    Deny mosquitos a chance to breed.\n    Check for all sources of stagnant water, especially fresh water such as plates of plants, flower vases, AC trays, gully traps, unused toilet bowls, concrete drains etc\n    Change water in flower pots regularly\n    Keep flower vases dry\n    If symptoms of dengue like fever, body ache, head ache, rash etc occur, immediately consult a doctor."}

I was exhausted but kept pumping,\" Safia Shaikh, 28, told dna.\nIn the end, it wasn't dengue alone that killed Safia's baby on November 5. It was also the fact that life-saving medical equipment was not available in the municipal hospitals for little Samiya.\nDays after the 4-month-old died of dengue, Safia told dna about the harrowing ordeal she and her husband faced over the past week to acquire a ventilator in a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\nSamiya's death brought into focus the inadequate infrastructure in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) hospitals, which is unable to support a growing number of ailing children, especially during the dengue outbreak.\nSafia said that, on October 30, little Samiya had a running nose and cough. On November 1, however, Samiya became breathless, said her father Masiullah Shaikh (33). Masiullah works as an AC repairer with a private company. \"As she also had high fever, we took her to a private doctor who recommended that she be shifted to the BMC-run Sion hospital,\" said Masiullah.\nThe flustered Shaikhs, who live in a Kurla (E) slum, reached Sion hospital with their breathless baby, only to realise that Samiya could not be allotted a bed. The reason given was that all PICU beds with ventilators were full. Of the 14 PICU beds in the hospital, only nine have ventilators.\nBMC health commissioner Sanjay Deshmukh had earlier in the week said that enough doctors, medicines and beds were available to treat patients.\nEven as the couple wanted to shift a critical Samiya to the BMC-run KEM hospital, no ambulance was available. \"The state-run helpline (108), which provides free ambulance service, was of no use. We had to hire a private vehicle late at night,\" said Safia.\nEven as Samiya hung between life and death at KEM, doctors never told the parents that their baby had tested positive for dengue (NS1 antigen test). \"She succumbed in the PICU on November 5 at 9 am but only on post-mortem was it revealed in the death certificate that she died of dengue,\" Masiullah said.\nMasiullah and Safia are now worried about their elder daughter, one-and-a-half-year-old Rabia, who is fever-stricken since November 3. They took her to BMC-run Bhabha and Sion hospitals, but doctors refused to admit the child due to overcrowding of patients, Safia said.\n\"They turned us away. The doctors even refused to conduct Rabia's blood tests. We are taking her to a private doctor now for treatment,\" said Safia.\nTwo months ago, another child had died of dengue in the paediatric medicine department of KEM, said Dr Mukesh Agarwal, head, paediatric medicine.\nEvery day, for the past few months, KEM hospital sees at least two admissions of children suffering from dengue.\nSamiya is the twelfth and youngest casualty this year. BMC's health department has yet not verified the death. \"The death certificate mentions cause of death as dengue.

With the civic administration\u2019s latest survey revealing that more than 50 per cent cases are in high-rises and posh societies, residents have started coming together to control mosquito growth in their area. In October alone, 962 suspected dengue cases were reported by major private hospitals in the city. Within a week in November, civic officials reported 204 confirmed cases. Five persons succumbed to the mosquito-borne viral infection in one week now. The death of Jyoti Dalvi (43) a few days ago jolted Dosti Society. On Friday, civic staff led by local corporator Trushna Vishwasrao fumigated the entire society area. \u201cShe was a mother of two small children. She was a very dear friend. Her death has come as a shock to all of us. She ignored her fever for four days. After inspection, we have found that there was water accumulation beneath her building\u2019s lift. That stagnant water was the breeding ground for dengue mosquitoes,\u201d Ms Vishwasrao said. At least two dengue cases were detected in the Dosti housing complex, which has 15 high-rises and over 1,200 flats. Friends of Wadala East, an NGO working in the area, has joined hands with builder Dosti Realty to undertake a fumigation campaign on Sunday. \u201cThere has been a lot of awareness about dengue in the recent past. We have also been reading about many media reports explaining the dos and don\u2019ts to prevent the disease. The dengue mosquitoes breed in stagnant fresh water. We observed that lot of water in the parking areas remains stagnant. Typically, after the vehicles are washed, water does not evaporate. Such water has become a threat. So we have organised this drive to fumigate specifically parking lots,\u201d Vipul Bondal, trustee of Friends of Wadala East. Dosti Realty bought a private set for fumigating the entire area. \u201cWe have kept this massive campaign on for the past two months. When the initial few cases were detected in the area, we immediately put our act together. We bought our own pump, medicines. We ensured that apart from the housing societies, even the labour camps are sanitised regularly. Ultimately, this is a matter of self-discipline,\u201d Kartik Himmatlal Goradia, Project Manager, Dosti Realty, said.

Usually selling at Rs 50 per piece, the fruit is now commanding Rs 80 in city markets. Fruit sellers say the supply usually dips in winter season.\nConsumption of papaya is considered beneficial and so the fruit is always in good demand. These days, doctors advice the suspect Malaria and Dengue patients to eat Papaya so as to increase blood platelets, which also a reason for the sudden demand. However, the fruit is in short supply during the winter. While the fruit sells at Rs 18-20/kg in the wholesale market, the cost escalates in retail market. Several vendors at Naupada and fruit market in Jambhli Naka were selling the fruit at a premium between Rs 50-80/kg.\nSanjay Pansare, director of APMC agreed the supply was less, but expressed surprise at the difference in rates in the Thane retail markets. \"The number of trucks arriving with papayas has dropped to 15 from 40-50.\" It is surprising that the fruit sells at such a premium in the city market as the rates are not as high in Mumbai where you get the fruit for Rs 35-40/kg,\" he said. Meanwhile, regulars continue to patronize the fruit despite it costing more. \"We have the fruit daily as it is good for health. The fruit becomes a rarity in this season but the rates are high this year,\" said Sunil Gupta, a Kapurbawdi resident.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Papaya,malaria,DENGUE,APMC\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

The hostel\u2019s bathrooms also had breeding sites. All the scrap material has now been shifted to the basement of the hospital to prevent further breeding and continuous fogging is being done,\u201d Naringrekar told Newsline.\nOn October 27, Dr Shruti Khobragade, a third year resident doctor at the hospital\u2019s anaesthesia department, succumbed to the ailment after a week-long treatment in Hinduja Hospital. Khobragade was the seventh case of dengue death in the city this year.\nThe first death took place on August 4 following the onset of monsoons.\nAccording to staffers attached with KEM hospital, despite the Swachh Bharat campaign during which the entire hospital was allegedly cleaned by doctors, nurses and staffers, the hospital lacks regular cleaning and hostels have become a host to mosquitoes.\nProvisional data from the civic health department confirms that the city has recorded 167 dengue cases in September and 174 additional cases in October. According to data from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, Maharashtra has recorded 2,997 dengue cases till September end \u2013 the highest in the country so far.\nA resident doctor in tertiary-care in Sion hospital said that fogging is rarely done in the hospital premises where over eight resident doctors are already suffering from dengue. \u201cThe cleanliness drive is not very aggressive. At least, we have not seen hostels being cleaned to stop mosquito breeding,\u201d the doctor said.\nWhile an administrative officer said that Nair hospital is conducting fogging twice a week in the premises, a nurse attached with the hospital said, \u201cThe hospital is short of cleaning staff. The wards are not clean and the toilets encourage mosquito breeding. Fogging is not the only solution.\u201d\nLast year, the city recorded 189 dengue cases in October. While the cases are more or less the same this year, experts have claimed that the dengue virus is attacking quicker and patients, now, require longer hospitalization.\n\u201cPeople are developing symptoms early now and instead of getting cured in three-four days, the hospital admission is stretching for over a week,\u201d Dr Om Srivastava, head of infectious disease department at Jaslok hospital, said.\nAccording to Dr Mangala Gomare, dengue cases see a spike generally after September due to favourable weather conditions.\nSanjay Deshmukh, additional municipal commissioner at BMC, said, \u201cWe have increased the radio and TV advertisements on mosquito breeding.

According to Dr. Mangala Gomare, epidemiology cell head at the BMC, there have been 650 cases of dengue in Mumbai in the last month, pointing out that south Mumbai has some of the most virulent attacks, with over 500 being reported in 30 days. In a statement to Mumbai Mirror , Dr Paratit Samadani, senior physician who consults at Saifee, Bhatia, Jaslok and Cumbala Hill hospital said, \u2018Every day I am seeing around five dengue cases. In the last two months, I have seen at least 200 cases especially from south Mumbai.\u2019 In the same vein, Dr Zahir Kazi, also reiterated the fact that he had seen over 100 cases of dengue in the last month.

His wife Neetu said that he is \u2018getting better\u2019 in a statement to Mumbai Mirror. Dengue is transmitted by the Ades aegypti mosquito that breeds in areas where stagnant water pools like air-conditioner ducts, plant pots, discarded garbage, and construction material.\u00a0What makes matters worse for people living in south Mumbai is the fact that along with the large number of constructions around in the area, further enhancing the breeding of mosquitoes, BMC officials have found that several apartment buildings have become rich breeding grounds for the causative mosquitoes. According to reports by the Mumbai Mirror, on Wednesday two BMC officers surveyed two apartment complexes around Breach Candy Hospital, where several residents were diagnosed with dengue and found that since one of the buildings was being renovated and there was a leak in the pipeline of the building, the water had stagnated on the terrace and at the back of the building, forming a perfect breeding ground for Ades aegypti larve and mosquitoes. So much so, that they found a number of larve in the pools of water and flower pots around the area. Amongst the areas that have had dengue cases, the ones with the most infections are Nagpada, Masjid, Mazgaon, Byculla, Prabhadevi, Worli and Bandra.

The figure has been hovering at 40-50 patients each week at civic hospitals for the last two months.\nThe private sector has reported an outbreak of sorts through September and October, but no figures are available.\nSouth and central Mumbai have had more cases than the suburbs, said BMC's epidemiology officer Dr Mangala Gomare. \"We have had cases from Mazgaon, Byculla, Dadar, Worli as well as Bandra.\" A spurt was also noted in Goregaon in western Mumbai and Ghatkopar in the eastern suburbs, she added.\nBMC officials blamed the weather and Mumbai's citizens for prolonging the dengue misery. \"Dengue-spreading mosquitoes (Aedes Aegypti) breed well in humid weather when the temperature is between 18 and 40 degrees,\" said BMC's chief insecticide officer R Naringekar. Mumbai thus makes for ideal breeding grounds till mid-November. Dr Gomare said dengue cases could drop next week if the temperatures fall.\nThe weather disadvantage has been compounded by the Mumbaikars' lack of cleanliness. \"A few days ago, our officials got a call from a Bandra housing colony that had a dengue case. On surveying the building, we found hundreds of larvae in potted plants. One family had kept a coconut with a green shoot in a bucket of water that was buzzing with Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes,\" Naringekar added.\nKEM Hospital dean Dr Shubhangi Parkar, who held a meeting with civic engineers, complained that relatives of patients keep throwing styrofoam cups everywhere. \"Our cleanliness teams say they have to clear cups every half an hour,\" she said. Dengue mosquitoes can breed even in small amounts of water in cups.\nThe insecticide team visited KEM, Sion and Nair hospitals and hostels on Tuesday. Doctors from these three have tested positive for dengue. \"We have told the dean water-logging within and around the hospital and hostels should be cleared immediately,'' said Dr M Baviskar, the MARD representative at KEM. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has also sought separate beds for doctors who fall ill on duty.\nOn Sunday, Shruti Khobragade (23) from KEM Hospital's anaesthesia department succumbed to dengue within a week of diagnosis.

Breaking down the statistics The information provided by the BMC's health department also points at Mumbai having as many as 167 cases in September itself, while October has 134 so far. Dr Kanchan Jagtap, joint director, epidemiology department of state government said, \"Since January, we have reported 3,565 dengue cases in Maharashtra, out of which Chandrapur leads the chart at 636. Mumbai corporation has been doing excellent work in the awareness and control. It has reported 347 cases.\" What has led to the rise in Dengue cases? Dr Jagtap also said that it was the intermittent rainfall that has led to a rise in Dengue cases, but Dengue case positivity remains the same as last year \u2013 at 10-12%. What areas have the highest cases? Dr Mangala Gomare, head of the epidemiology department in the BMC, said, \"Dadar, Parel, Prabhadevi, Walkeshwar, Bandra, Ghatkopar are still showing high incidence of dengue. We are hoping that with a dip in temperature, there will be a fall in the cases too.\" Breeding sites of the mosquito that carries the virus The BMC health official said that 80% of the breeding sites of the Aedes mosquito, carrier of the virus, are found indoors. Around 60% of such cases are seen in affluent housing societies where the department has found breeding spots in mini-fountains, feng-shui plants and miniature artificial ponds. BMC staff working overtime to clear backlogs With elections over, BMC has asked its staff from the health department not to take extra leaves and work extra to clear backlogs. \"Many of our staff had to work double shifts because of election duty, but now they are back. They are still working extra hours to complete the backlog. We have requested them not to take extra holidays, apart from public holidays for Diwali. We will see the result in next 10-15 days,\" said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC. People with co-morbidities to be more wary Doctors have warned people with co-morbidities (the presence of additional ailments) like diabetes or hypertension to be more careful. \"People shouldn't take fever lightly. Early diagnosis is a must because with co-morbid factors, complications can increase if not treated on time,\" said Dr Khusrav Bajan, an intensivist at PD Hinduja Hospital. Many doctors are also tending to patients positive for malaria, dengue and typhoid."}

Chandrapur has recorded the highest number of dengue cases (636) this year and one confirmed one dengue-related death so far. While Mumbai has recorded five dengue deaths with 532 cases so far this year. About 30% of the cases in the state are from Chandrapur and Mumbai. \u201cBoth the districts have different breeding sites. In Chandrapur, we have found dengue-spreading mosquitoes breeding in water in coal mines and forests, while Mumbai witnesses breeding at spots in houses and housing complexes,\u201d said Dr Kanchan Jagtap, from the state health department. The Chandrapur district has, so far, reported 23 outbreaks. \u201cMost of the cases were from 100 villages in the region, in August and September. Plastic bottles and water containers acted as breeding ground in a majority of the cases,\u201d said Dr Shriram Gogulwar, district health officer of Chandrapur. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, however, claim the rise is a result of increased awareness about reporting such cases. \u201cThe trend this year is no different from last year. The number of cases is almost the same,\u201d said Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of epidemiology cell, BMC. Last month, the state health department had called for a meeting of district officers to discuss ways in which the spread of the disease can be controlled. Jagtap said only 10% of the samples tested positive for dengue. \u201cThe number is almost the same, so there is no need to panic,\u201d said Jagtap.

Five prime hospitals in the island city have treated over 400 patients for dengue in the last 40 days but very few needed critical care.\n\n \n\n The deceased, a 55-year-old renal transplant patient from Walkeshwar, was shifted to Jaslok Hospital on September 29, from another hospital in a critical condition. Her platelets had dropped to 20,000 (normal ranges from 1.5 to 4.5 lakh). She also suffered internal bleeding and seizures. Dr Tarang Gianchandani, CEO of Jaslok Hospital, said she passed away on October 5.\n\n \n\n Dr Gianchandani said their hospital alone has treated over 60 serious dengue cases in the last 30 days. Other leading hospitals, including Bombay, Breach Candy, Cumballa Hill and Bhatia, are witnessing a similar rush. The BMC's official figures that show only 41 dengue cases in the first week of October are nowhere close to the ground reality.\n\n \n\n Dr Pratit Samdani, who consults in several hospitals, said areas such as Peddar Road, Malabar Hill, Nepean Sea Road and Walkeshwar are swarmed with dengue. \"In a Nepean Sea Road building, 16 people were affected at the same time. The numbers are very high, but the cases are not very serious though we have seen involvement of the liver, heart, brain, low platelet counts and low pulse rates.\"\n\n \n\n On the bright side though, the spurt is not leading to too many hospitalizations or deaths. Dr Hemant Thacker, consultant physician at Bhatia and Breach Candy hospitals, said, \"There is a lot of panic when people hear dengue. It is treatable and hospitalization is hardly required in 10% of the cases.\" Dr Samdani said the key to treating dengue is hydrating the patient and not unnecessary platelet transfusions. \"We have given patients up to 10 litres of fluid in a day and treated them successfully.\"\n\n"}

Almost 50% of the pesticide department staffs and health post staffs are on election duty which is having a direct affect on the fogging drive and awareness work.\nHow many cases were reported last month?\nIn September, 117 dengue cases have been registered in the city which is almost twice the figure in August (65) and July (52).\nWhat is BMC's take?\nDr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer with the BMC, said, \"Majority of the staff is on election duty. In few wards, like Bandra East, Borivali, the entire pesticide department staff is on election duty. It has definitely affected\nthe anti larval activity which has a set pattern.\"What are the worst affected areas?\nWhile health department staffs are being assigned election duties, parts of the city are seeing a drastic rise in dengue cases. Dr Mangala Gomare, head of the epidemiology, BMC said, \"Areas like Bandra east and west, Goregaon, Prabhadevi, Dadar are seeing more dengue cases. We are monitoring the dengue cases being reported in the city on a daily basis.\"\nWhat is the solution?According to Keskar, a request has been made to higher-ups for replacements or additions. \"Most of the staffs are working over-time. We are some how managing the work. We hope there will be replacement soon,\" said Dr Keskar.\n80% of breeding sites found indoorsDr Gomare said 80% of the mosquito breeding sites have been found indoors and therefore awareness among people on aedes mosquito breeding is very important. \"The Aedes mosquito (carrier of dengue virus) breeding spots are being found in mini-fountains, feng-shui plants and miniature artificial ponds. Unlike locating the breeding sites of the female Anopheles mosquito (which spreads malaria), it is difficult to find those of the Aedes mosquito as we have to visit homes for that,\" said Dr Gomare.\nHow to reach out to posh areas?\nAccording to BMC health department, 60% of the Aedes mosquito breeding spots are reported in posh residential areas. \"We are doing door-to-door visits in slum areas. For non-slum areas, we are trying to get in touch via ALMs and communicating via emails and pamphlets. Radio jingles, local cable channels help is also being taken,\" said Dr Gomare.\nDos and don'ts: To ensure your house doesn't become a breeding site for dengue-spreading mosquitoes:\n1. Change water of ornamental plants' pots and flower vases in your house every alternate day\n2. Make sure there is no stagnant water collecting in garden drains, roof gutters and sun shades\n3.

So much so, doctors are now worried about a health scare, especially because of the severity of the disease this season.\nThere were 117 dengue cases in September, compared to 65 in August and 52 in July .\n\"Three years ago, demand for platelets used to be for malaria. Now, it is for dengue. We have been seeing a surge in demand in the last few days and we are closely keeping a watch,\" said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council.\nDr Lalit Pawar, blood transfusion officer, Sadguru Charitable Blood Bank, Koperkhairane, said: \"Generally, we need 20-25 Random Donor Platelet a day. In the last two months, demand has gone up. Everyday, we provide 80-85 RDP. Sometimes, we are not able to provide RDP. Sometimes we ask relatives to donate blood to create RDP.\"\nThere are 310 blood banks across the state, of which 225 have the facility to separate and store platelets.\nWhat's a platelet?\nPlatelet is a blood component that helps in blood clotting. A platelet transfusion is prescribed to dengue patients when its count falls below 20,000. When platelet count falls below 20,000, it may lead to spontaneous bleeding. Normal platelet count for individuals may range within 1.5-4 lakh.\nWhy's there a sudden rise in dengue cases?\n\"There seems to be a change in vector transmission. Compared to last year, we are seeing more dengue cases in October. Intermittent rainfall, change in temperature, environment and humidity are a few factors,\" Dr Om Shrivastav, director of the department of infectious diseases at Jaslok hospital, explains.\nHow scary can platelet count fall be?\nSays Shrivastav, \"We are seeing severe forms of dengue this year where the frequency in the dip of platelet count is very fast. For example, in 48 hours, the count can fall from 2 lakh to 10-15,000 and remain so for 5-7 days. In such cases, we have to hospitalise the patient, otherwise he may bleed spontaneously.\"\nWhy is there a scarcity of platelets?\nSome doctors say many hospitals resort to platelet administration to be on safer side. This leads to increase in demand. Says Dr Khusrav Bajan, intensivist, PD Hinduja hospital, \"There is a misuse of platelets by many. One should not go for platelet administration until the count has gone below 10,000. Transfusions are done even when the count is between 40,000 and 80,000. Many doctors suggest it, fearing bleeding.\" It's of utmost importance to monitor platelet count of patients with dengue symptoms regularly.\nWhat's BMC saying?\nSays Dr Mangala Gomare, who is in charge of the epidemiology department: \"Hospitalisation cases are going up. We are seeing the same pattern of rise in dengue cases like last year. As a precautionary step, we have intensified our anti-dengue drive.\"\n2\n\n XXXXXX  Daily News & Analysis"}

After lying low for the first quarter of the year, the mosquito-borne infection has shown a sudden spurt with cases going up from 29 in May to 62 in June.\n\"January saw a sudden spurt with 39 cases, which came down to 8 in February, further down to 4 in March, and rising slightly to 12 cases in April. Pre-monsoon showers in May and early June resulted in water stagnation, which provides fitting ground for growth of Aedes aegypti mosquito. Besides, people living in fringe localities face water scarcity due to which they tend to store water - another favourable breeding spot for dengue-causing mosquitoes,\" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).\nAnother reason for high number of cases this year could be PMC health department's initiative to collate data from private hospitals. Earlier, the PMC would collect data only from the government-run Sassoon General Hospital and the civic hospitals.\n\"There are 14 ward offices in Pune. Dengue cases have so far been found in all ward offices. However, there is no need to panic. Our health staff is active in controlling the spread. People need to be careful and vigilant. It is vital to tackle mosquito breeding sites to prevent dengue,\" said an official from the insect control department.\n\"Proper solid waste disposal and improved water storage practices, including covering containers to prevent access to egg-laying female mosquitoes, should be followed,\" said the official.\nDuring the last two years of study, the PMC has found that the number of severe cases has dropped, indicating better patient management and increased awareness about the disease.\nResearchers found multiple serotypes circulating throughout, with the emergence of DENV-4 in 2009. Besides, they found that the adult population (20-40) is the worst affected.\nClimatic conditions favourable for breeding of mosquitoes, increased storage of water, increasing construction activity, piling of garbage and lack of public awareness about the measures that need to be taken have aggravated the situation, say experts.\nPMC yet to purchase insecticide to curb mosquito meanace\nThe Pune Municipal Corporation's (PMC) insect control department has run out of basic insecticides required during fogging of mosquito-breeding sites. In fact, no purchase has been made during 2013-14.\n\"Work orders have been placed and the insecticides will be made available within a week. Currently, we are borrowing the fogging material from state health department,\" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health, PMC.\nThe civic body has identified 70,075 mosquito-breeding spots in the city that need constant surveillance and spraying.\nCommonly used insecticides to fight vector-borne diseases are Abate (a dengue larvicide), Glysophet (which is sprayed on water hyacinth to prevent breeding), Pyrethrum (used for fogging), and Cifluthrin, Bifenthrin and Solpac powder used for indoor spraying. Malaria Larvicide oil is used to kill mosquitoes breeding on drainage water while Vectobac is sprayed on stagnant water.\nThe standing committee recently approved tender purchase of commonly used insecticides worth Rs 2.69 crore for the year 2014-15.\nDo's and Don'ts\n* Remove water from coolers and other small containers at least once in a week\n* Do not wear clothes that expose arms and legs\n* Children should not be allowed to play in shorts and half sleeved clothes\n* Use mosquito nets or repellents while sleeping during day time\nBreeding places\nDesert coolers, drums, jars, pots, buckets, flower vases, plant saucers, tanks, cisterns, bottles, tins, tyres, roof gutters, refrigerator drip pans, cement blocks, cemetery urns, bamboo stumps, coconut shells, tree holes and many more places where rainwater collects or is stored\nSymptoms\n* Abrupt onset of high fever\n* Severe frontal headache\n* Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement\n* Muscle and joint pain\n* Loss of sense of taste and appetite\n* Measles-like rash over chest and upper limbs\n* Nausea and vomiting\n(Source: Directorate of National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, New Delhi)\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

However, the PMC says the number is much higher because the state does not consider patients reported by private doctors.\nA total of 649 cases and 17 deaths were recorded from January to May last year. This year, the death toll is just three, but number of positive cases has leaped to 722. Navi Mumbai, Ahmednagar and Dhule have reported one death each.\nThe health department has blamed the prevailing weather conditions for the spurt. \"The initial drizzle and showers resulted in water accumulation, thus creating conducive breeding ground for Aedes Aegypti -mosquito that causes dengue,\" said a senior health official.\nThe low fatality rate indicates better surveillance and timely diagnosis and treatment, the official said.\nThis year, most cases have been reported from rural areas. Among them, Chandrapur tops the list (205 cases) followed by Dhule (49), Beed (39), Wardha (25), Thane (19), Solapur (17), Pune (15) and Amravati (13). Among municipal corporations, Greater Mumbai has reported 135 cases followed by Thane (20), Nasik (11) and Pimpri Chinchwad (11).\n\"Dengue, as we know it, has always been a very urban disease. Unplanned growth and construction activities are reasons for rise in dengue cases in urban as well as rural areas, including small towns that are also witnessing rapid urbanisation,\" another official said.\nWhen dengue gets complicated, it progresses to the stage of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and further to Dengue Shock Syndrome(DSS). Chances of cross-infection, or subsequent infections by two strains can be the reasons for the severity of cases.\nIn India, dengue outbreaks have been reported since the 1950s. It was labelled an urban disease and was considered to be a self-limiting infection with fever and body ache as common symptoms. Since late 1980s, the occurrence of severe dengue changed its profile.\n\"The trend continues and today severe disease is seen in most cities. The fatality rate can vary from 0.1% to 1.5% depending on the treatment given. Most major cities are now endemic and have annual seasonal rise in activity. In Maharashtra, for example, dengue is endemic in Mumbai, Pune, Sangli, Wai, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Jalgaon and Nagpur. Dengue has now spread to rural areas and claimed newer regions,\" said a scientist from NIV.\nMosquito control has been a long standing problem and has not been solved even by countries with better infrastructure.\nOfficials said every house/school/office/factory or any unit, for that matter, should make an effort to see there are no discarded tyres, plastic bags, containers, broken plastic ware in the vicinity where water can accumulate .\nYear wise break-up\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Civic health officials in both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporations said on Wednesday that the number of cases has shot up in June and asked people to take necessary steps to ensure water doesn\u2019t stagnate near their residential areas. PMC\u2019s health department has reported 24 cases of dengue and four cases of malaria until June 11 alone.\u00a0 The same number stood at 34 dengue cases and 15 malaria cases reported for the entire month of June in 2013. In PCMC area too, the number of cases are rising with 14 cases of dengue and 12 cases of malaria till June end this year, compared to only two dengue and 41 malaria cases until end of June 2013. PMC health officer Dr ST Pardeshi admitted to a rise in number of cases and that the health department officials were keeping a check on it but clarified that it wasn\u2019t an alarming situation yet. \u201cThe first step is that people must ensure houses observe a dry day once a week. They should not allow stagnation of water in or around houses. Fresh water should be covered at all times to prevent access to egg-laying female mosquitoes and proper garbage disposal system should be followed. It is advisable to report to a doctor after two days of unchecked fever, bodyache, headache accompanied by rash like symptoms,\u201d he advised. Health officials said that since the mosquito, aedes aegypti, that spreads dengue, breeds in fresh water, it is imperative for every household to observe one day a week as \u2018dry day\u2019, when all utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned. Dnyaneshwar Dhore, Executive Officer, Health Department, PCMC said that a survey of areas sensitive to water logging and vulnerable by population in the PCMC area was ongoing. \u201cWe are removing man-made and natural sources of water stagnation. Our department personnel are on the field doing survey at construction sites, tyre puncture shops, slum areas and congested places for water containers like tyres, dug holes, plastic bottles and other products. We are also paying visit to houses and societies and making people aware to not allow water to stagnate in refrigerators, airconditioners plastic containers, tyres etc in and around their houses,\u201d he said. Doctors advise that people suffering from fever as high as 103/104 degrees Fahrenheit, along with headache, body pain, dehydration and nausea, should consult a doctor right away. \u00a0 Precautions\u00a0to be taken: \u2022 Observe one day in a week as \u2018dry day\u2019, when all utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned. \u2022 Deny mosquitoes chance to breed \u2022 Prevent formation of stagnant water, especially fresh water in plates of plants, flower vases, AC trays, gully traps, unused toilet bowls, concrete drains etc \u2022 Change water in flower pots routinely\u00a0 \u2022 Keep flower vases dry as much as possible"}

Trash talk: Some of the main reasons for the spread of diseases are uncovered dustbins and improper disposal of garbage   &nbsp;   Going by these statistics, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is targeting vector-borne diseases, and has started a campaign called 'Small bite: big threat'. In Pune, this issue has gone viral, as vector-borne diseases have doubled in the past year.  Dr Atul Joshi from Sahyadri Hospital said, \"There is an increase in the number of vector-borne diseases in the city and the reasons are manifold &mdash; unhygienic conditions surrounding residential areas, uncovered dustbins, improper disposal of garbage and apathetic approach of the health department.\"  Doctors said that the victims of these debilitating viral diseases are mostly children. Jehangir Hospital alone has examined and treated nearly 200 children suffering from vector-borne diseases last year.  Dr Sanjay Bafna, consultant paediatrician from the hospital said, \"There has been a steady rise in such diseases among children due to precautionary measures not being implemented efficiently. These diseases can lead to serious complications and even result in death. Preventive steps need to be taken effectively to keep diseases under control.\"  Dr Deepa Divekar, medical director of Sahyadri Hospitals and director of research and academics, said, \"When we see symptoms like chills in our infant patients, we suggest various tests like rapid malaria test and other necessary ones.  If the case is serious, the patient is shifted to the ICU where the beds are covered with mosquito nets. In such cases, special care is taken by the infection control team of our hospital.\"  Vector-borne infectious diseases are emerging due to resistance from insecticides and drugs, shift in emphasis from prevention to emergency response, demographic and societal changes, and genetic changes in pathogens.  Divekar said, \"The civic body should sanitise areas that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes like nurseries, public toilets and stagnant water ponds by spraying.\"  Officialspeak  Assistant Medical Officer (Insect Control), Pune Municipal Corporation, Dr Vaishali Jadhav, said, \"In the city, the cases of malaria and chikungunya have reduced but the cases of dengue are on the rise.  There were no deaths caused due to malaria or Chikungunya during 2012-14, but in 2012, there were six deaths caused by dengue and five in 2013, and no reported deaths till now in 2014.\"  It has been observed that mosquito breeding sites in the city have increased, as it is has risen by nearly seven per cent in such sites from 2012 to 2013.  Jadhav added, \"We are identifying breeding sites and treating them with guppy fish, which eat up the larvae. They are usually found in areas where construction work is on. &nbsp;   How to keep mosquitoes away   Mosquito repellents should be used at home. &gt;  &nbsp;Windows should be covered with nets to avoid mosquitoes from entering your home.

Eighty per cent of the people in the city who got mosquito-borne diseases, mainly dengue, had vector breeding spots right at their homes.

This is done to ensure that others living there do not contract it. It is our common observation that most of those who get dengue have breeding spots right inside their houses,\" said Pardeshi. The mosquito breeds primarily in man-made containers like earthenware jars, metal drums and concrete cisterns, plastic food containers, used automobile tyres that retain water.

As many as 53 patients are undergoing treatment at PMCH, 17 at Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science, Patna and one at SKMCH, Muzaffarpur.\nWith the rising cases, the demand for platelets has gone up. PMCH blood bank is giving away 20-30 units of platelets everyday, while Jaya Prabha blood bank is giving away 18-20 units. Red Cross is supplying 10-12 units everyday. The blood banks are finding it difficult to cope up with the rising demand. Platelets are given to any patient if the count drops below 40,000.\nMeanwhile, the PMC's New Capital Circle has only one big machine which is defunct and 26 small machines, of which 16 are defunct. PMC claims of fogging with malathion in a few wards of the circle is largely refuted by the residents. Bankipore circle has 10 small machines, of which five are defunct. The circle has one big machine. Kankarbagh circle, which is one of the dengue-hit areas of the state capital, has one defunct big machine. It has ten small machines, of which eight are defunct. Bankipore's big machine is, at times, hired by Kankarbagh circle. Patna City circle is worst in terms of fogging. It has one big machine and 17 small machines, all of which are defunct and by PMC's own admission, the circle has never witnessed fogging this season. Incidentally, Gaighat of Patna City circle is one of the areas from where dengue patients are coming in clusters.\nDengue is generally fatal if it takes the form of haemorrhagic fever in which the platelet count drops abnormally. Its typical symptoms are bleeding from nose, black stool and bleeding and coughing with fever. Otherwise, the common symptoms of dengue are fever with headache, joint pain, rashes and nausea, said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. Doctors advise clean water must not be allowed to stagnate in flower pots or in offices/homes because aedes breeds there only. Mosquito repellents must be used in daytime as aedes bites at that time.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=SKMCH,PMCH,Patna Municipal Corporation,DENGUE\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Common symptoms of viral fever are sore throat, body pain and persistent fever along with running nose. Over 30% cases are that of viral fever,\" said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. Though it affects all age groups, elderly and children are the most vulnerable as their immunity is low. People suffering from co-morbidities like diabetes and heart ailments are also exposed to viral infection.\nThe virus can get transmitted if the affected person sneezes or coughs. So the person affected by viral fever should be kept in isolation and he/she must avoid going to public places. \"A WHO-prescribed vaccine is available now that creates immunity against influenza virus for at leat a year,\" said Dr Tejaswi.\nMet department, however, says the temperature difference these days is on expected lines. \"The maximum and minimum temperature difference is about 10 degree-11 degree Celsius. This is common before the winter finally sets in. Winter, otherwise, is expected to arrive not earlier than 15 days,\" said Patna Met office director A K Sen.\nSo far as dengue is concerned, the number of confirmed cases in Patna went up to 53 on Friday. According to Patna civil surgeon's office, two more cases of dengue were detected on Monday and their blood samples for ELISA test have been sent to PMCH. The confirmation report will come on Tuesday. Doctors say malarial cases are also on the rise. While malaria is caused by the bite of plasmodium falciparum, dengue is caused by aedes mosquito.\nDoctors say clean water should not be allowed to accumulate as the mosquitoes causing dengue breed there. Water kept in buckets or unused room coolers or any container is perfect breeding ground for the these mosquitoes. Doctors suggest kerosene oil drops must be sprayed so that the mosquito gets killed, apart from the spraying done by PMC or the health department.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Viral fever,Patna,malaria,DENGUE\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

The public should also keep their surroundings spic and span,\u201d Mariyappan said.

Rajaiah, on Wednesday said the government would soon install 25 platelet separator machines at different hospitals across Telangana. He said this was one of the measures being undertaken by the government to strengthen health care in the State.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister told reporters after visiting the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) Adilabad, that the government would also ask doctors in rural areas to take up awareness programmes to eliminate the feeling of insecurity among common people. He said people were feeling insecure owing to the falsehood being spread by private and corporate hospitals regarding the spread of dengue.\nMr. Rajaiah reiterated that there was not even one death due to dengue recorded so far in the State. He however, conceded that 465 positive cases of dengue had been identified across the State.\nTalking in detail about the disease, the Health Minister said depletion of platelets did not mean that the illness was dengue. He said people had died of other reasons in the district, especially the agency area, though he did not specify the number of deaths or the causes due to which the deaths had occurred in recent months.\nThe Deputy Chief Minister later visited Utnoor hospital. He had earlier reviewed the situation with doctors and officials in the district.\nNizamabad Special Correspondent adds: Asking hospital authorities to send proposals to add another 100 beds in the 500-bedded Government Medical College cum Teaching Hospital, Dr. Rajaiah said an amount of Rs.31 crore was sanctioned for the construction of a nursing school and college to be attached to the medical college. If the district administration identifies required land for the purpose, it will become a reality, he said.\nMember of Parliament K. Kavitha said that with the release of Rs. 28 crore for improving facilities, the MCI had granted sanction to the medical college for the second year. The remaining Rs. 32 crore will also be released soon. Admitting that dengue fever was prevalent across the State, she said with the timely intervention of doctors, it could be controlled.\n\n XXXXXX  The Hindu"}

However, the absence of an effective mechanism to monitor and report diseases such as malaria and dengue is resulting in the state health department officials working with incorrect number of cases of those suffering from the diseases resulting in inadequate measures for disease control.\nThough officials claim the state records about 4,000 malaria cases every year, sources said the actual figures may be in thousands more as most malaria cases go unreported. While the state run clinics or hospitals keep records of cases and report them regularly to the health department, this is not the case with respect to almost all private doctors, clinics and hospitals.\nThe health department does not have an effective mechanism that ensures reporting of all malaria cases to the District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) of respective districts.\nFor instance, there are about 1,700 private hospitals including super specialty hospitals in Hyderabad. Though it is mandatory to send case details of Malaria, Dengue, Polio, TB and Hepatitis B to district health wing, many private hospitals ignore it. \"The idea of getting cases details from hospitals is that the state government can take up preventive measures in the areas where the cases are being reported. In the absence of cases details, it would be a herculean task for the department to tackle the situation,\" a deputy director of Health and Family Welfare said. Several districts in Telangana are currently in the grip of Malaria and other viral fevers even as the state government is struggling to tackle the situation by taking up measures.\nCurrently several hundreds of villages in Khammam and Adilabad districts are in the grip of Malaria and fever cases. The situation is alarming in the villages bordering Chattisgarh state and Utnoor agency area in Adilabad district.\nWith respect to Greater Hyderabad, though officials say Malaria cases are under control, residents of several colonies are suffering from Malaria and other viral fevers. Officials said there is a rise in Malaria cases in the districts like Khammam, Adilabad and Warangal compared to last year. According to officials, of total 1,941 cases till this August, as many as 1,199 cases were reported in Khammam. district till August end. Similarly 334 cases in Adilabad, 160 in Warangal district and 180 cases in Hyderabad were reported. A total of 1,941 cases were reported in the entire state till August this year. In Khammam district, only 890 cases were reported till August last year and this year the cases reached to nearly 1200. When it comes to Adilabad the cases in the corresponding year (August 2013), 520 Malaria cases were detected. \"We are not completely relying on the private hospitals for collection of information. Our Asha workers and supervisors have been asked to collect information on the fevers. The department will take action against the hospitals and clinics that do not report such cases including cancellation of registration,\" P Venkateshwarlu, DMHO of Hyderabad said.\nGenerally Malaria cases are reported between June and November months (monsoon) as there are chances of water stagnation in the lakes, roads and other places like water coolers. The health department takes up control measures by using gambusia fish, fogging and spraying of pesticides.\n\"There is a spurt in Malaria cases in some districts. I visited some of the villages near Utnoor agency area in Adilabad district where the panchayats have not been taking any steps for maintaining sanitationSimilarly some municipalities are not lifting garbage on day to day basis which is leading to mosquitoes breeding in towns,\" director of health and family welfare Pilli Sambasiva Rao told STOI.\nOfficials said the department has taken up awareness programmes urging people not to store water in coolers and their backyards, maintain dry day on every Friday by removing water. The department is also organising camps in identified villages in every district apart from taking up house to house survey.\nAmazon.in : Buy it\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Pilli Sambasiva Rao,malaria cases,hepatitis B,Health officials\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

He alleged that officials in the district were not recording the correct number of deaths due to malaria in the district. Meanwhile, responding to it the district health officer denied that the number of malaria deaths issued by the government was lower than the actual number. H. S. Shivakumar, District health Officer (DHO), said the government got daily reports from private and government hospitals, which were analysed and sent to the State level. When asked about the numbers going unreported, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s his (Dr. Kakkilaya\u2019s) imagination\u201d and that he would discuss the issue with him. Dr. Shivakumar said that it was not correct that anaemia could lead to malaria but malaria could lead to anaemia. He said the death of the two minors was \u201cunfortunate\u201d especially as the area they lived in was not a malaria-endemic area. The Hindu called Bangalore doctors at several different points of time but did not get a response."}

He said the rise in cases of malaria and water borne diseases was reported from Longtraivalley and Gandacherra sub-divisions in Dhalai district and Kanchanpur sub-division in North Tripura in past few weeks. Asked about the probable reasons of the outbreak, the minister said with receding water levels in streams and water bodies in the winter, villagers were often found to use poison and chemicals in the river water for easy catch of fishes. \"Surface water from rivers is used as primary source in the drinking water treatment plants. Use of poison or chemicals in the river water might be one of the reasons,\" Chowdhury added. Six water treatment plants were functional in Longtraivalley sub-division alone where the attacks were reported intensive, he said. The minister, however, denied the situation to be serious and said malaria and water borne diseases were found to increase in the areas during winters every year. \"We had similar experience over the past two decades,\" he said adding the department took all necessary precautions to contain any large scale escalation of the situation. \"We met officials of the local administration ranging from District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates to our health care officials including Sub-Divisional Medical officers (SDMO) and Medical Officer in-charge (MOIC) in all major blocks where attacks were detected and officials were instructed to make sure everything was in place,\" Chowdhury said. Over 98 malaria deaths were reported in Tripura earlier this year, one of the worst malaria outbreaks in the region."}

The silver lining though is that deaths have fallen by over 71% compared to last year. Experts from the National Institute of Virology have found that a dengue strain commonly found in Jabalpur, MP, is behind the epidemic in Chandrapur, Wardha and Beed. \"When we examined samples from Chandrapur, we found the dengue strain has travelled from Jabalpur,\" said Dr Satish Pawar, head, Directorate of Health Services.\nIncidentally, Mumbai does not fare among the districts showing an overwhelming increase. If official figures are to be believed, there were 767 cases last October as compared to 696 this year. Around 4,000-odd cases that were reported by private hospitals this October do not reflect in the city's official dengue count. BMC's epidemiologist Dr Mangala Gomare, however, said, \"We did see more cases compared to last year. But if we look at the November figures, dengue seems to be decreasing,\" she said.\nThe city's dengue toll, including November, now sta8nds at 12 with over 760 cases. Thane and Mira Bhayander too have shown 128% and 97% rise respectively. Pawar said outbreaks at Chandrapur have been controlled now.

This season it has claimed nine lives, which is one less from the year's official dengue casualty. It has also affected at least 10 times the number of people attacked by the dengue virus.\nMalaria, also transmitted by mosquitoes, has clocked around 7,500 cases and caused nine deaths. At the state-level too, there have been 33 deaths due to malaria and over 33,000 cases this year. Experts, however, feel the population is less threatened by malaria now.\n\"The threat from dengue is much bigger. The element of unpredictability in diagnosis and treatment makes it very challenging,\" said a senior doctor from KEM Hospital in Parel. The doctor added, \"It can almost be said conclusively that dengue has taken over malaria as the primary infectious disease of the city. With the existing conditions, it is a scary trend\".\nInfectious disease experts, too, agree. Dr Om Srivastava from Jaslok Hospital seconded that there has been a paradigm shift in infectious diseases. \"Earlier, a fever patient was first suspected of malaria but that has now changed to dengue,\" he said, adding that the shift needs to be studied in detail to tackle it better. \"It is possible that the vectors are same but they have become more infectious. Or, that their breeding patterns, life cycle or transmissibility has changed,\" he said, adding that malaria seems to be under control.\nWhile, malaria has seen a drastic 58% dip in cases and deaths over the last five years, the story of dengue has been quite the opposite. Dengue cases and casualties have astronomically jumped from a few hundred cases to thousands. Even by the civic body's official count, often under scrutiny for under-reporting, cases have risen by 84% since 2010. This year, 4,000 dengue cases reported in October by the private sector have been categorized as 'suspected'.\n\"Out of 10 fever cases, seven are dengue and three malaria. The trend was exactly the opposite till few years back,\" said Dr Nivedita Moulick, head of medicine at Sion Hospital. She added that malaria cases continue to lurk in the community but dengue has become predominant.\nKanchan Jagtap, joint director, state public health department, said the time has come to resort to intervention methods, including micro-mapping, door-to-door screening and awareness campaigns that had worked for malaria. She added that a definite pattern has emerged for dengue. \"Cases start trickling from June, peak in October and die down by November,\" she said.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=private,malaria,Maharashtra,hospitals,DENGUE\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

XXXXXX City docs worry over rising trend of infant dengue cases\nBy\u00a0Jyoti ShelarJyoti Shelar, Mumbai Mirror | Nov 20, 2014, 12.00 AM IST\nFour-month-old Samiya Shaikh died of dengue\nRELATED\nDoctors are worried about the increasing trend of infants contracting dengue in the city. While a five-month-old boy is currently battling for his life at Parel's KEM Hospital and is on ventilator, the deadly disease took the life of a four-month-old baby girl in the same hospital earlier this month.\nDr Mukesh Agarwal, Head of KEM Hospital's paediatric department, said it is extremely rare for such young babies to get infected even though there have been a lot of such cases this season. \"New born babies are generally always wrapped well and are kept in a much protected environment and it is difficult for them to contract the disease,\" he said. However, four-monthold Samiya Shaikh, who was being treated under him, succumbed to the disease on November 6.\nMeanwhile, civic-run Sion Hospital has admitted as many as seven infants suffering from dengue between September and October. \"A majority of these patients were four or five month olds,\" said Dr Mamta Manglani, the head of Sion Hospital's paediatric department. She also said that most babies have maternal antibodies that generally protect them against the dengue virus. \"However, if the baby gets infected with a different strain of dengue, then there is no protection,\" explained Manglani.\nThe dengue virus (DEN) comprises of four distinct serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). If a mother is infected with any of these strains, the baby carries the mother's antibodies and is protected against the same strain. \"However, if the baby gets infected with another strain, it is termed as a secondary infection which is extremely severe and the fatality rate is extremely high in such cases,\" explained Dr Bhupendra Awasthi, director of Surya Child Care at Santacruz, adding that they have treated three infants for dengue in the past two months. \"Babies are extremely sensitive and hence the fluid supplements should be carefully watched. Anything excess can be fatal too,\" he said.\nDoctors also pointed out that babies are prone to reduced platelet levels even when they have a regular viral or bacterial infection. Since dengue cases are being underreported, many fatalities could well be categorised as sepsis or infection related death and the underlying cause of dengue goes unnoticed.\nAccording to paediatrician Dr Uday Pai who practices at Chembur, newborns are at risk because there is no place that is practically mosquito-free. \"There is dirt and garbage in every corner.

A death that occurred 19 days back too came to light, taking Mumbai's toll due to the mosquito-borne disease to 15 this year. Of these, eight have died in November alone.\nWhile Vijay Bhosale (35) died at Holy Family Hospital, Bandra, at 4.30pm on Wednesday, BMC's chief epidemiology officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the 14-year-old died in civic-run KEM Hospital, Parel, on Tuesday. \"The girl was visiting from UP,'' said Dr Gomare, adding her death would not be counted in Mumbai's toll.\nIncidentally, a dengue-related death that occurred in a Ghatkopar hospital on October 31 has come to light. Chembur resident Khusboo Ansari (34) was admitted to two other hospitals before succumbing to dengue's complications at Aashirwad Heart Hospital.\nBMC officials refused to elaborate on the deaths, saying they would give out comprehensive figures after a six-member investigation committee meets in a day or two.\n\"We have confirmed 10 deaths due to dengue in the city this year. There are several others that have been notified to us, but we will talk about them only after our committee establishes that dengue was the cause of death,'' said Dr Gomare.\nThe toll in Mumbai thus stands at 15, according to the BMC. While the BMC has confirmed that 10 deaths were due to dengue this year, the remaining five have been classified as deaths due to \"suspected dengue''.\nThe BMC has been attacked for not coming clean on the extent of dengue's assault on Mumbai. Its public health department gives out weekly health reports collated only from BMC's hospitals, keeping mum on the dengue positive reports sent from private hospitals.\nOn Tuesday, its latest health report stated that 41 patients in its hospitals had tested positive for dengue in the second week of November. In October, BMC admitted that 4,000 Mumbaikars were suspected to have dengue.\nPrivate hospital doctors, meanwhile, have been reporting dozens of cases a week. \"Dengue is still around, though the number of cases coming in daily is lower than that a week back,'' said a doctor from Mahim.\nOn Wednesday, Vijay Bhonsale who lived in a chawl in Khar Danda and worked with a private housekeeping firm, died at Holy Family Hospital, Bandra, after being admitted there around midnight on Friday. His neighbour and friend Samir More said, \"A local doctor with whom Vijay was seeking treatment for fever advised him to check for dengue. The test came positive around Friday afternoon and Vijay's condition seemed to worsen,'' said More. Bhonsale was taken to Bhabha Hospital in Bandra around 7 pm. \"But he started vomiting blood within a few hours and had to be rushed to Holy Family thereafter as he needed a ventilator,'' said More, adding that Bhonsale never regained consciousness. Bhonsale is survived by a three-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter.\nHoly Family Hospital's Dr J Jadwani, who treated Bhonsale, said, \"He came to us in a critical condition. He had dengue as well as encephalopathy,'' said Dr Jadwani.\nIn the dengue death on October 31, Ansari got admitted to two local nursing homes with high fever and bodyache on October 27. \"As her condition worsened at the second hospital, we were told to shift her to a facility that had a ventilator,'' said her husband Ainul Ansari. She was then taken to Aashirwad Hospital in Ghatkopar late on October 30.

Private practioners and laboratories also have seen a rise in cases and the total number of cases are more than what is being reported.\"\n\nThe alarm bells are ringing as the number of cases has jumped four times since last year - while 150 cases were reported in BMC run hospitals in 2013, this year that number has crossed 650. \n\nThe BMC admits it has a situation at hand.

With no specific treatment, precaution is the key. Experts say early mornings and evenings is when people need to be extra careful as that is when the dengue mosquitos are generally more active.\n\nDr Shubhangi Parkar, the Dean of KEM Hospital in Mumbai, which is the hub for treating dengue cases, told NDTV, \"Early identification is key. No one should not take fever lightly and think nothing will happen. Those with symptoms should go to the doctor immediately so that investigations are automatically done and proper medication is given. For dengue there is nothing like anti-dengue treatment.\"\n\nWhat is however a good sign is that the number of cases reported in the last three days has come down by nearly 50 per cent and the BMC claims its efforts to control the situation is working."}

Further, 740 cases have been confirmed this year. Doctors have hinted at a steady rise in cases this year, and are worried by the number of heart patients who are showing symptoms of the mosquito-borne infection.\u201cThere were three cases in which patients on blood thinners had contracted the dengue infection. We had to take them off blood thinners, so their platelet levels were not affected.

The study says 420 dengue patients were treated in KEM between January 1 and December 31, 2013, of which 22 died and every third patient was in the 21-30 age group.\nBut Dr Mangala Gomare of BMC's epidemiology cell said she has not heard about the study and would not be able to comment on it. \"The number of deaths could be higher because super specialty hospitals, like KEM, get many patients from outside the city and we don't include them in Mumbai's statistics,\" she added.\nThe study was done by doctors of KEM Hospital's preventive social medicine department (PSM) as a debriefing session of sorts\u2014recording the type of treatment given to patients, its outcome and any possible gap in treatment. PSM departments provide inputs that help local governments draw up ways to combat diseases at the community level.\nThe KEM study provides an overview of the disease's patterns: maximum deaths occurred in September and October 2013 at six each. \"There was no treatment gap found in cases of deaths, but 36% of the patients who had died received antimalarial treatment even after being diagnosed with dengue. This may indicate that antimalarial treatment in these 34% patients leads to resistance for the treatment,\" concluded the study.\nDr Ranendra Shinde, who is one of the co-authors of the study and head of KEM Hospital's PSM department, said, \"The study's significance is that it proves that dengue has become the most common vector-borne disease in Mumbai at the moment. In 2012, we had more cases of malaria than dengue. In 2013, both the mosquito-borne infections were equal but, in 2014, it is obvious that dengue is more common.\"\nSuch analysis help in noting that any case of fever in Mumbai should first be tested for dengue, especially in September and October. Asked about the disparity between his department's study and public health department's statistics, Dr Shinde said this may be due to lack of uniformity in writing death certificates.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=research study,Public Health Department,preventive social medicine department,patients,Mangala Gomare\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

One Surendra Barik (25) of Binchana village died of the disease on Thursday night. The first dengue death was reported from Kabisuryanagar block where Mamata Kar (42) of Athagadapatana died in the first week of this month. Subsequently, the disease claimed the life of Santosh Nahak (36) of B Nuapalli of the same block. Sambaru Das (55) of S Nuagaon in Patrapur block died a few days back. And as many as 70 persons from Kabisuryanagar, Dharakote and Patrapur have been affected and are undergoing treatment at various hospitals. District Malaria Officer, Dr Umasankar Mishra, said so far samples of around 300 patients in the district have been collected of which, 29 were found to be dengue positive. \u201cBut none of the patients have died of dengue in hospitals,\u201d he clarified. Sources, however, said of the four dengue deaths, three died in their homes but Mamata was admitted to MKCH Medical College and Hospital. In the absence of doctors and proper treatment, she had to be shifted to a private hospital in Bhubaneswar where she succumbed. Sources added that as private hospitals seldom submit their records to the district health office, all deaths are not recorded. Meanwhile, Berhampur Municipal Corporation (BMC) has already started its awareness campaigns to arrest the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue. A chariot, Nidhi Rath, has been doing rounds of the district as a part of the campaign. In wake of rain, waterlogging in the low-lying areas has been a cause of concern. BMC officials stressed the need to clean drains and waterlogged areas to destroy mosquito larvae. Besides launching the awareness programme, the civic body sprayed insecticides at certain areas, said a corporation health official. According to official sources, as many as 42 dengue cases were reported in Berhampur town as against 143 in the entire Ganjam district last year. The main reason for spread of dengue, chikungunya, malaria and Japanese Encephalitis is stagnation of water, which helps the spread of infection, said a medical officer of the social medicine department, MKCG Medical College and Hospital here. BMC authorities said immediate measures are being taken in the city to curb possible breeding points of aedes mosquitoes, which are the vectors of this viral disease. The thrust is on domestic breeding points as aedes mosquitoes breed at any place inside the house where there is stagnant water. According to experts, the aedes mosquitoes have very short flight range which is only 100 to 500 metres, and due to this dengue cases always get concentrated in small pockets."}

Chief Minister Manik Sarkar held a high-level meeting in Agartala on Thursday and reviewed the situation. \"To deal with the situation effectively, leaves of all doctors, nurses and health workers have been cancelled. Health officials are visiting remote villages and making arrangements to bring the malaria affected people to the government hospitals,\" the minister said. \"We are contemplating to take punitive actions against the health workers for negligence of their duties and outbreak of the disease in a short span,\" he added. A helicopter was made ready to ferry the doctors, health staffs and patients in emergency. Five temporary medical camps are functioning in the affected areas to treat those down with malaria and take preventive measures. The government has been advised by the experts to use second-generation medicine instead of traditional medicines to prevent malaria deaths. The health department has already stocked sufficient medicines in each sub-division and health centre to ensure speedy and effective treatment. All eight northeastern states, besides West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka, are highly malaria prone, where several hundred people die every year.

It resulted in flooding the wards of Lal Bahadur Shastri government hospital with patients, including women and children suffering from diarrhoea. Chief medical officer MP Chaurasia admitted that the supply of contaminated water in some localities of cis-Ganga localities had created the problem. The Varanasi Municipal Corporation and Ramnagar Palika Parishad were asked to ensure immediate repair of water supply pipelines to avoid spread of waterborne diseases.\nThe officials said that a number of patients suffering from gastroenteritis, food poisoning and heat stroke is also high. The records of SPG Hospital and DDU Hospital show that more than 20 patients suffering from these problems are being rushed to the emergency wards per day while more than 10% of about 1,000 patients turning up to the OPDs have similar complaints.\nChaurasia said that in marriage season, hygiene factor is being overlooked by many while catering food articles to the guests. It is a major reason behind the increase in problem of gastroenteritis and food poisoning.\nSuperintending-in-chief of SPG Hospital SC Mishra said that sufficient beds have been reserved in emergency ward for the people turning up with problems like heat stroke, diarrhoea and gastroenteritis. More rooms are being arranged at upper floors of ward four to meet the situation. These arrangements can be made for a limited period as the availability of nursing and paramilitary staff in the hospital is insufficient to handle additional arrangements for long.\nThe CMO said that stock of medicine has been checked while a budget of Rs 11 lakhs was received on Thursday for the purchase of zinc and ORS solutions.\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

It also underlined the need to improve coordination between various government departments to control its spread. The state has reported 5,382 cases and 31 deaths till October.\nThe state health authorities also exhorted local self government bodies in rural and urban areas to intensify surveillance and identify as well as treat every fever case promptly. Director of the state health department Satish Pawar and joint director Kanchan Jagtap held a meeting of deputy directors, assistant directors and district health officers (DHO), district malaria officers (DMO) and civil surgeons via video conferencing on Friday to review dengue situation in the state.\n\"We have been following the guidelines of National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) for vector control and treatment. We have been emphasizing on following these guidelines that includes surveillance and control measures. We have asked officials to follow these guidelines uniformly without missing any parameter,\" said Kanchan Jagtap.\nWhen there was a chikungunya outbreak in 2005 in Maharashtra, various government departments had worked together to control the spread. \"We need to function the same way to control dengue now. For this, we need enhanced coordination of rural and urban development departments. Apart from the health department, education and women and child welfare departments also have key roles to play in reining in the spread,\" said H H Chavan, deputy director (Pune circle) of the state health department.\nAlthough the number of dengue cases has shown a steady rise every year, the mortality rate has been going down steadily. The overall mortality rate of 1.2% in 2007 dropped to 0.25% in 2013. \"This reduction is probably the result of cumulative effects of better patient management, increased diagnostic capabilities and better reporting,\" said a state health official.\nMost major cities in the country are now endemic and have annual seasonal rise in activity. In Maharashtra, for example, dengue is endemic in Mumbai, Pune, Sangli, Wai, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Jalgaon and Nagpur. Dengue has now spread to rural areas and claimed newer regions.\n\"Every house, school, office, factory or any unit for that matter should make an effort to see that there are no discarded tyres, plastic bags, containers, broken plastic ware in the vicinity where water can accumulate and provide breeding ground to mosquitoes,\" Jagtap said.\nAmazon.in : Buy now\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=state health department,Satish Pawar,chikungunya\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\u2019s mobile apps.

Typhoid is water borne, mostly caused by contaminated tap water where sewage water could be getting mixed with tap water due leaking pipes. Dengue is mosquito borne, just like Malaria, but a different breed of mosquitoe known an aedes aegypti. And dengue is definitely most virulent of the three since a patient can go into Dengue Shock syndrome which is mostly fatal. \u201cEven if one ensures that there is cleanliness and no stagnant rain water in your house and two houses on either side of yours, you can prevent being bitten by a Dengue mosquito since \u2018aedes aegypti\u2019 cannot fly very far unlike the malaria causing mosquito\u201d said Dr. Meraj Shaikh, an Intensivist (critical care Doctor) at CARE Hospital, Nagpur. In the past few months, CARE has seen a lot of Dengue patients, between 50 and 100 at a rough estimate. One case has been fatal. Dengue can affect different patients differently, opined Dr. Shaikh, Those with better resistance and over all health can be mildly affected while patients in extreme age groups \u2013 i.e. either very young or very old \u2013 can be severely affected. \u201cBut this is not a hard and fast rule. Even a very healthy looking person in the prime of youth can go into Dengue Shock Syndrome, so any fever should be immediately reported to your Doctor who will advise you to go in for a blood test \u201d warned Dr. Meraj Shaikh. Once a patient goes into DSS he can go into organ failure \u2013 any vital organ of the body like lungs, heart, kidney or liver could fail leading to fatality. The case of a 3 year old girl dying in Mumbai after just a few days of fever is causing alarm everywhere in the state, coupled with the fact that a lot of Doctors themselves are catching the disease. This is because hospitals themselves are sometime not maintained properly and have accumulated water in some spots or even in AC ducts. This has been found to be the case in JJ Hospital, Mumbai where employees quarters and students\u2019 hostels were found to be the mosquito breeding areas. Also, knowledge about how to Differentiate Between Malaria, Dengue and Chikungunya Symptoms is necessary: - Generally Dengue and Chikungunya are caused by infected Aedes Agypti (also Aedes Albopictus for chikungunya) which is active during the day and loves to breed as close to us as mosquitoly possible (open, clean water storage areas at home) whereas Malaria is caused by Anopheles which is prevalent during the night (even at dusk/dawn). - Dengue takes 3 to 4 days for symptoms to set in and generally lasts for a week, whereas Chikungunya takes a week for symptoms to set in. In Malaria, the symptoms start after 2 weeks of mosquito bite. - In all 3 cases body temperature is above 102\u2070 F and common symptoms are sudden high fever, pain behind the eyes, severe headache, muscle, joint pain, vomiting, nausea, anemia, general weakness/dizziness. - Dengue is differentiated by fever subside and reappear with skin rashes. Bleeding is also common in the cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. It also shows relatively low WBC and platelet count. - Chikungunya has intense joint pain (when compared to dengue). Unlike dengue there is no bleeding in chikungunya. - Malaria includes fever which keeps reoccurring in shorter duration accompanied by chills, heat and sweating which follows one after the other. Malaria is tested by microscopic examination of the sample and there are very effective anti malarial drugs available. Testing for Dengue involves virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection or specific antibodies (serology) like IgG and IgM ( this may not be evident at the early onset of the infection) . There are no vaccines or specific medicines available for Dengue or Chikungunya as yet. Only symptoms can be treated with the available general medicines. Chikungunya is diagnosed by virus isolation test, antibody testing of IgM as well as by genetic identification of virus gene structures. Detection of either C or E1 genome indicates positive result. It is always safe to keep the house and surrounding area clean, free from unwanted waste, stagnant or open water sources either clean or dirty. Ensure the house is well protected with detachable mesh and repellents. Once you are infected, make sure you are well hydrated, drink only boiled water and rest well."}

Of the 11 entomologist positions in the state health department, eight have been lying vacant for more than seven years now. With cases mounting, state health officials said they will now expedite the process to fill up these critical vacancies.\n\n \n\n Entomologists are specialists who study the way insects and vectors cause and transmit diseases. Their role is important for both prevention and control of diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya as they can identify infected vectors and issue warnings in case of an impending outbreak.\n\n \n\n \"There is one state entomologist post, which is filled. But of the 10 posts for junior entomologists, eight have been lying vacant for more than seven years now,\" said a state health official requesting anonymity.\n\n \n\n The state health department has eight divisions across the state. Barring Pune, which has two junior entomologists, posts at remaining seven divisions of Aurangabad, Nashik, Akola, Latur, Nagpur, Thane and Kolhapur have been lying vacant.\n\n \n\n \"A public entomologist's primary concern is to focus on the population biology of vector-borne infections. They seek to understand how pathogens perpetuate over time and devise methods to reduce the burden that they impose on human health,\" said a former state entomologist.\n\n \n\n Officials rue the poor importance given to these specialists not just in Maharashtra but elsewhere too. \"Entomologists have not been given enough importance in the public health sector. Many states have disbanded the cadre and stopped recruiting, and that is why many states have failed to identify mass breeding of vectors and are reporting dengue and malaria outbreaks.\"\n\n \n\n Vehicles too are not allotted to entomologists to carry out field work, but they get vehicles of other officials temporarily when there is a rise in infections.\n\n \n\n Posts of lab technicians and multipurpose workers, who carry out the surveillance work, too have been lying vacant, albeit not in large numbers, but significant enough at a time when dengue has become a major health concern across Maharashtra.\n\n \n\n \"Of a total of 2,014 sanctioned posts for lab technicians, 60 have been lying vacant. And of the 12,000 posts of multipurpose workers, 2,000 have also been lying vacant. The multipurpose workers are trained personnel who carry out entomological surveillance and other miscellaneous disease prevention work. Lab technicians carry out tests on collected blood samples of patients suspected to be suffering from malaria or filaria on which further treatment relies,\" said a state health official.\n\n \n\n Maharashtra has recorded a total 3,565 dengue cases and 24 deaths so far this year. Pune tops the list for recording the highest - six deaths - in the state. All the six were local residents of Pune city.\n\n \n\n The state health authorities have in the past few days pointed out that entomological surveillance data was not evaluated satisfactorily.\n\n \n\n When contacted Kanchan Jagtap, joint director (vector borne diseases) of state health department said the posts had been lying vacant, but that had not really affected the surveillance work.\n\n \n\n \"Eight posts have been lying vacant but that does not mean that vector surveillance work is not carried out in the divisions where there are no entomologist. Thesurveillance is carried out by district malaria officers and insect collectors and multipurpose workers. We have expedited the process of filling the posts now,\" said Jagtap.\n\n \n\n Asked why the posts had not been filled, Jagtap said that there are two ways the posts are filled. \"We can fill the post by direct recruitment through MPSC and through promotions. Almost half of the posts that need to be filled through promotions could not be filled as the work of an entomologist is technical and only those with that qualification and training can be promoted to the post,\" she said.\n\n \n\n Why do we need entomologist ?\n\n \n\n * Medical entomologists study the way insects and vectors cause and transmit disease\n\n \n\n * They conduct the vector surveillance and take steps to prevent and control the spread of vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria and chikungunya\n\n \n\n * They provide advice and carries out surveillance, monitoring, and control of insects and related animals that affect human health. It primarily performs a public health function with the aim of reducing the impact of insects of medical importance on the health and well being of the people\n\n \n\n * They assess various entomological parameters in field such as vector density, larval density, susceptibility status of vectors to various insecticides and larvicides\n\n \n\n * They study vector bionomics - their resting, feeding, breeding habits and mosquito blood meal analysis\n\n \n\n * They supervise the indoor residual spraying (IRS) and carry out various field studies during IRS\n\n \n\n * In outbreak situations, they visit the place and carry out entomological survey and co-relate the findings with clinical symptoms of the disease and confirm the outbreak\n\n"}

Insecticides were finally procured by July end.\n\"There is no denying that we could not purchase insecticides for the last one-and-a-half years. Activists working in the field had raised objections over their purchase at a higher rate though that was not the case. But the objections stalled the process of purchase throughout last year. On May 13 this year, the standing committee approved the tender for purchasing insecticides worth Rs 2.69 crore for 2014-15. However, due to inter-departmental differences, the tender process got further delayed. The insecticides were finally made available towards the end of July,\" said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), PMC.\nPardeshi, however, said the civic health department would borrow insecticides from state health department to check the mosquito menace during this period. \"We borrowed essential insecticides from state health officials whenever needed,\" he added.\nHowever, it wasn't just non-availability of insecticides that were the only hurdle in containing the mosquito menace. The civic body's insect control department has been reeling from a staff crunch of field workers for the last many years. \"Around 40 % of field worker posts and super field workers are still vacant. These are the people who actually make door to door visits, spray insecticides and educate people about precautionary measures to prevent indoor mosquito breeding,\" said a senior health official.\n\"Earlier, we had 300 field workers. An additional 150 field workers were taken recently on contract a month ago,\" said Sanjeev Wavare, assistant medical officer of health (AMoH) and head of insect control department. Wavare took charge of the insect control department in July end.\nFor the year 2014-15, PMC's health department has been allocated a budget of Rs 12.75 lakh, but when TOI probed officials about the amount spent on awareness, they admitted that barring printing of handbills this month, the money has remained largely underutilised.\n\"We have printed three lakh pamphlets this month. Barring the expense of approximately Rs 4 lakh gone into their printing, the funds have remained unutilized,\" said a senior civic health official requesting anonymity.\nIn 2012, the Union health ministry's team had carried out larval survey in the dengue-affected areas of Pune city and had observed that the PMC had failed in carrying out adequate health education activities among its citizens about how to tackle the breeding sites of Aedes aegypti mosquito, the dengue vector.\nCalling it a collective failure of the civic body and civic administration, senior activist Maj Gen (retd) SCN Jatar said that successive municipal commissioners should have used their powers to contain outbreak of dengue. \"It is sad that successive municipal commissioners have paid little attention to health. Corporators also raise their voice when their relatives and friends get affected. Inappropriate handling of garbage is also one of the reasons for rise in mosquito borne infections in Pune city,\" Jatar said.\nVector-borne diseases have been rising since June. The city continues to report a substantial number of dengue cases every day since then. On Friday, 35 fresh cases were reported. With this, the tally of positive cases rose to 2,237.

Frequent changes in weather have caused an unusual spurt in dengue cases over the last week, leading to patients crowding medical clinics in the city.\nTwo patients, both residents of Jalna, succumbed to the disease while undergoing treatment at a city hospital.\nIntensivist at Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital Varun Gawli, where the two were undergoing treatment, said that they had examined more than 15 dengue patients in the last one month. \"Most of these patients were from the adjoining Jalna and Buldhana districts. Unfortunately, two patients died during treatment, while three are still admitted in the hospital,\" he said.\nDengue fever is a disease transmitted by a mosquito bite. It is caused by one of the four closely related dengue viruses that are transmitted primarily by the day-biting female Aedes aegypti mosquito. These mosquitoes breed in freshwater. These mosquitoes mostly bite in evening in the highly vascular parts of the body such as around the ankle and neck.\nKuldeepsing Raul, president of the Aurangabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association, said that he has seen around 4-5 cases of suspected dengue in last one week. Patients are coming in with complaints of continuous fever, back and knee pain, which are symptoms of dengue.\nDengue should be suspected when high fever (104\u00c2\u00b0F) is accompanied by two of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or rash. The symptoms usually last for 2-7 days, after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito, doctors said.\n\"Sporadic cases of dengue are being reported since the last one month. The reason is probably the recent spell of unseasonal rainfall. The dry spell before the rain and rise in the humidity levels might have been conducive for virus growth.\"\nThe patients are, however, from the adjoining districts and not Aurangabad city. Executive member of National Society for Critical Care Anand Nikalje said, \"I have seen quite a few suspected dengue cases. There were three cases from Jalna district. The condition of one of the patients was quite serious.\"\nHealth officials said that unlike in the past, dengue cases are now reported throughout the year. There is definitely a spurt in the monsoon season.\n\"The cases are often in clusters that have unsafe and stagnant water storage. Clear water in open containers or stagnating on buildings provides ideal breeding ground for the aedes aegypti mosquitoes that carry the dengue-causing flavivirus,\" said Zilla parishad health officer Sudhakar Shelke Shelke.\nWhenever it rains, stagnant water accumulates in discarded items strewn around the house. \"This is an ideal breeding ground for the mosquitoes and cases are often reported from such households,\" said Aurangabad region, assistant director, malaria, V S Bhatkar.\nHealth experts said that having proper drainage and sanitation facilities to prevent stagnation of water and regular fumigation will control the mosquito menace.\nNikhalje, who is also the medical superintendent of MIT Hospital, said that the number of patients approaching them this year is much higher compared with last year. \"Fogging near water bodies and in residential areas needs to be intensified,\" he said.\nDENGUE PREVENTION\nKey facts:\nDengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection.\nThe infection causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue.\nThe global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades.\nAbout half of the world's population is now at risk.\nDengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.\nSevere dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries.\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates below 1%.\nDengue prevention and control solely depends on effective vector control measures.\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES\nThe first and foremost effort should be taken to prevent Aedes from breeding.\nRemove all sources of stagnant water.\nChange water in vases alternate days.\nRemove water from flowerpot trays alternate days.\nTurn over all water pails and storage containers.\nClear blockages and put insecticides in roof gutters monthly.\nDo not litter. Rubbish such as cups and water bottles can collect rain water and breed mosquitoes.\nIF YOU ARE GOING FOR HOLIDAYS KEEP THIS IN MIND:\nCover all toilet bowls before going on vacation.\nSeal off the overflow pipe of the flushing cistern.\nCover all gully or floor traps.\nAdd sand granular insecticide to places that mosquitoes could potentially breed, such as flower vases and places where stagnant water could not be removed.\nTurn over all water storage containers.\nAsk a relative or close friend to check your home regularly for stagnant water if you are going away for a long period of time.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Inputs by Senior medical practitioner, Anand Nikalje\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}
