The mosquito feeds exclusively on humans. It is active during the day and is likely to breed in any water container. This is general information. Since I am not a doctor, I cannot say anything about treatment being provided by the Military hospital doctors there.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cSince the Dengue fever has already spread in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts, we are taking all possible precautions. Our Military hospital and concerned doctors are fully prepared to handle dengue cases. We\u2019ve already taken measures to prevent spread of Dengue among forces personnel.\u201d\n\nHe informed that after detecting the first case of Dengue in the military hospital, the hospital administration started fogging operation and also took other measures to prevent the spread of Dengue among army personnel. \n\n\u201cFogging operations are underway in hospital and other areas to minimize the chances of spread of Dengue. The Military hospital and concerned authorities are carrying out fogging with the spray of insecticides in family quarters and units surrounding the residences of the personnel whose cases were confirmed as Dengue cases.\u201d \n\nIn the meanwhile, Directorate Health Services Jammu, which is struggling hard to contain Dengue in Jammu region, is not aware of exact number of Dengue cases in the Military Hospital.\n\nDirector Health Services Jammu Dr B S Pathania, when contacted, \u201cWe have not received any information regarding any Dengue case in the 166- Military Hospital. We have already alerted all concerned authorities with the direction to inform the Health Department about such cases if confirmed. We\u2019ve also asked the authorities to go for fogging in the area to protect the people from Dengue.\u201d\n\nReplying to query about 168 dengue cases in the Military Hospital, he said, \u201cThe department had approached them but the Military Hospital did not reveal any information about said cases. The hospital authorities asked us to approach Nagrota or Northern Command Headquarters as they had sent all the details vis-\u00e0-vis dengue cases to them. Let me approach the Northern Command Headquarters to get the details about the dengue cases.\u201d"}

Reason being, the disease has already claimed three lives in these two districts, one in Jammu district and two in Samba district.\n\nConfirming 12 new cases today, Director Health Services Jammu Dr B S Pathania, while talking to KTNS, said, \u201cDengue will peak in the month of October as the conditions become conducive for the vector-born disease to proliferate.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Health department is taking all possible steps to contain the spread of Dengue which seems to be taking epidemic proportions, Jammu division is registering average 35-40 suspected new cases every day. Till October 8 evening, the Directorate Health Services, Jammu had recorded 979 suspected patients, out of whom 393 were confirmed positive, in the division. \n\nEven the officials in the health department admit that though the department has waged an all out war against this disease by doing whatever is possible, the spread of dengue has accentuated.\n\nRecently, the health department opened new blood collection centers in Samba, Vijaypur, Purmandal, Gurah Slathia, Bari Brahmana, Ramgarh, Kathua but the final test which is known as ELISA is only carried out in Government Medical College (GMC) Hospital, Jammu.\n\nEarlier, the state health department had put a ban on Rapid serology test i.e.NS1 for diagnosing Dengue by clinics, hospitals, nursing homes and clinical establishments and recommended National Institute of Virology Kit commonly known as ELISA test to confirm Dengue.\n\nThe department asked the citizens to keep their surroundings clean and not allow water to collect anywhere in their vicinity. It also formed three teams to constantly monitor the situation."}

Addressing a joint meeting of party senior leaders, legislators, district and zone presidents and prominent workers the party president Mehbooba Mufti said the coalition government had left no one in any doubt about its intentions, priorities and inability to address people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problems. Senior party leaders Maulvi Iftikhar Hussein Ansari, general secretary Mohammad Dilawar Mir, A R Veeri, Abdul Gaffar Sofi, Mohammad Rafi Mir, Nizamuddin Bhat, Naeem Akhtar, Syed Altaf Bukhari, Advocate Abdul Haq Khan, Peerzada Mansoor Hussein and Saifuddin Bhat also addressed the meeting.\n\n\n\nMehbooba said that the Omar Abdullah government had in four years of its rule brought immense miseries to the people and having refused to learn from its failures it has made its doom inevitable. She said people of the state now realise the difference that a state government can make to their lives and would surely respond to this through the democratic weapon of vote. She said this government had the advantage of having inherited a state that had by and large come back on rails after the militancy and repressive government of Farooq Abdullah between 1996 and 2002. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut instead of building on that solid foundation it mismanaged the situation so much that the state suffered humiliation as a political entity and its residents have once again been rendered destitute and disempowered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. She added that the rulers were focused only on their personal luxuries and dealt with people with an arrogance that borders on contempt.\n\n\n\n Declaring that the party would soon hold district level demonstrations against power crisis, non availability of cooking gas and rations and price rise, Mehbooba said power sector had shown great improvement up to 2008 and as soon as this government took charge it reintroduced the trademark NC schedule which meant more darkness than light even though the tariff has been raised four times in four years. She said during this period the state had added 500 MW additional power after the completion of its own projects but the supply has gone down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere has this additional power gone? Is the revenue from additional generation going into the luxuries of the rulers who go around in cars each worth more than a crore?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mehbooba wondered and said that the NC led government can no longer escape public scrutiny and they would face public wrath in elections no matter when.\n\n\n\n Mehbooba said that instead of addressing the grim cooking gas crisis and shortage of ration and water Omar Abdullah is coming up with a new slogan every day. When he faced accusations in the suspicious death of Haji Yousuf involving payoffs to his father Dr Farooq Abdullah for fixing mandates and berths in the cabinet he suddenly came out with the AFSPA roll back announcement. Having failed on every promise that he made before 2008 elections and ever after Omar Abdullah has now adopted the mantra of grand alliance. She told the party workers that it is the people of J&K who will decide about who forms the next government and no manipulations or mind games would succeed in the face of peoples power. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInstead of begging others for help in elections the chief minister should have found time to see the long queues of respectable people waiting for gas cylinders in sub zero temperatures and tried to reduce their miseries,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said and added \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor me personally it is most painful to see young and old, respectable people being treated like beggars\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\n Mehbooba said that the efforts at putting up a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrand alliance\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Omar Abdullah are in fact a loud and clear recognition of PDP as the leading political force of the state. She said the PDP had broken the barriers that faced traditional regional parties like the NC and because of its clear agenda and sincere leadership was finding acceptance among all the regions, sub regions and communities which augured well for the future of the state. She said it is only such a party that has acceptance across the state which could fight for the rights of its people and usher in an era of peace, economic prosperity and understanding between different stake holders.\n\n\n\n Referring to the unemployment problems, Mehbooba said our highly talented youth have been rendered idle because of the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to promote private sector and provide free and fair entry into government services. She said though the PDP led govt had been tied by the MOU signed by Farooq Abdullah government with the centre that no recruitment in the govt would be made it still provided govt jobs to thousands of young people. It had introduced very refreshing reforms which ensured that only the talented and deserving candidates got the jobs but this govt has again made back door the preferred entry point. She said that government agents and ruling party workers were now acting as brokers in fixing jobs against heavy bribes and it seems till this govt is in office the problems facing the youth and other sections of the people would only continue to mount. \n\n\n\n Referring to the recently held council elections Mehbooba thanked the large number of Panches and Sarpanches who had voted for PDP candidates. She said these elections had established that PDP had now a committed cadre of dedicated workers and village representatives who would stand up to threats and temptations and support the party even in tough circumstances. She said while that was a matter of satisfaction it was important that the party is strong enough to lead the people out of their problems which have been only mounting under successive NC regimes.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updated at : Thursday, December 20, 2012 No respite expected under this government: Mehbooba SRINAGAR, Dec 19: Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the present government has established its anti people credentials beyond any doubt and no respite from mounting miseries was expected till its exit.

This was confirmed by B S Pathania, Director Health Services (DHS) Jammu. However, the Dengue horror has already spread among the inhabitants of district Samba. If the sources are to be believed, state administration was taken by surprise after they detected several cases of dengue in the said area. They expressed complete helplessness in taking pro-active measures to prevent Dengue menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter 2006, when 42 cases of dengue had been reported, dengue has been reported only this year.

Replying to a query about measures being taken in controlling its spread, the director said, \u201cHealth Department in collaboration with Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) has provided \u201cMalathion\u201d for fogging to prevent the people from Dengue within the municipal limits.\u201d\n\nHe further added, \u201cFogging has been continuing in industrial areas which are more prone to dengue.

Department is carrying out fogging with insecticides in urban area along with focal spray of Insecticides in 50 houses surrounding the residence of the person confirmed as Dengue case.\u201d He added that GMC is the final authority for confirming the Dengue since it is this institution where expert doctor\u2019s team of Micro-Bacteriology Department examines patient.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in private labs that are deliberately spreading the Dengue panic in the region by examining blood reports through rapid kits and declared positive reports of Dengue. In this context, the Health department has already issued notification to private labs that are busy in minting money from the innocent people. We do not believe in any report until it is not examined by our Micro Bacteriology department for confirmation of Dengue through ELISA-IgM process as only process to confirm dengue.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Government Medical College (GMC), Jammu, Micro Bacteriology Department HOD Bela Mahajan told Kashmir Times, \u201cThe department has collected around 140 blood samples from different parts of the Jammu region and most of them were sent by Director Health Services for confirmation of Dengue which had been collected from the Government Hospital, Vijaypur, district Samba including their names and phone numbers so that the patients could be informed over the phone regarding confirmation of their blood reports.\u201d\n\nA Dengue victim patient admitted on Bed No-15 at GMC\u2019s Medicine Ward number-15, Jeet Kumar of Baghe-Bahu told KTNS that, \u201cMy parents brought me here on Monday after watching unstable condition and confirmed Dengue after blood samples tested positive in the hospital.

Medical staff on the condition of anonymity told Kashmir Times, \u201cDengue patients should be kept in isolation ward. The hospital authorities should arrange separate ward for concerned patients. They should be treated there instead of treating them with other patients.\u201d\n\nIn this context, R S Pura Block Medical Officer (BMO) Rajiv Sharma said, \u201cWe have not received any information regarding any Dengue case in R S Pura. We have alerted all concerned dispensaries to inform the BMO about such incident if identified and asked the corporation for fogging the area to protect the people from Dengue.\u201d The reports of 37 dengue cases were termed as misleading by Director Health as these cases were suspected but none could be confirmed."}

A decade ago, the state was touted as one where no female foeticide took place. So why our society is now aborting the girl child? In answer to this question I reached a Government Hospital in Srinagar with my female friend to collect some interviews for my studies.\n\n\n\nWhen sex ratio statistics from 2011 census were released, everyone in Jammu and Kashmir was shocked to see the declining trend of females in the last ten years. But not Rizwana (name changed here). She is working in that hospital from last 18 years; she knew that at what level the discrimination is done with the females in most of the Kashmiri households. As an attendant at the hospital for almost two decades, the nurse is watching the growing unwillingness of parents to have a girl child. I always see pregnant women praying for sons in the labour rooms, restless husbands waiting for the delivery and enquiring first about the sex of their child and revealing disappointed faces when a girl is born. The population of girls will keep going down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warns the nurse.\n\n\n\nOver the years, it has become common to see expectant couples undertake gender tests. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey use their connections, beg and try to offer money to check their unborn baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gender\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMostly we refuse but sometimes, the connections are too strong and we are forced to reveal the gender. But that is all we do, nothing more happens here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d implying that the hospital does not do illegal abortions.\n\n\n\nThe 2011 census data about alarmingly declining sex ratio in Jammu and Kashmir has surprised all of us. \"Child sex ratio (0-6 years), which is a more realistic indicator of trends in female foeticide. According to the 2011 census Jammu and Kashmir has shockingly 859 sex ratio, in comparison to national child sex ratio of 914\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This declining trend of the sex ratio is a dangerous drift for the humanity.\n\n\n\nSix Valley districts recorded sharp decline in sex ratio in the 2011 Census. Six Valley districts have recorded a sharp decline in sex ratio in the last ten years. These districts include Pulwama, Budgam, Kupwara, Ganderbal, Shopian and Kulgam. As per the 2011 Census, Pulwama has 836 females for every 1000 males against 1046 females and 1000 recorded during 2001 census, Budgam 832 ratio as per Census 2011 against 1004 in 2001, Kupwara 854 in 2011 against 1021 in 2001, Ganderbal 863 in 2011 against 1014 in 2001, while against a ratio of 1011 recorded during 2001 census, the gender ratio has plunged to 883 in Shopian during the last one decade. Similarly the sex ratio has come down to 882 in Kulgam against 1003 recorded in the previous census. \n\n\n\nIn the Jammu region, Child sex ratio decreased from 905 to 837 in Rajouri district in comparison to 1000 males and it is considered among one of the worst district where the discrimination against females was on its height in the last ten years. In Poonch it comes down from 959 to 932, Udhampur shows 912 to 887 females in comparison to 1000 males. In Jammu region eight districts out of ten has child sex ratio below the 900. If we have a look at the sex ratio of capitals of the state, winter capital Jammu has 871 sex ratio in comparison to 879 of summer capital Srinagar.\n\n\n\nDecline in the female sex ratio is worse in the urban areas of the Jammu and Kashmir than the rural one. It shows that practice of sex determination is more common in the civilized areas of the state. Peoples generally link the low sex ratio with the illiteracy. It is ironic that actually the educated peoples in civilized areas from majority of people who indulge in sex determination tests.\n\n\n\nThe declining sex ratio in Kashmir is much worse than Jammu which is tough to understand. The child sex ratio was 964 in 2001; in the current census it comes down to 859 in comparison to 914 national figures. It is the sharpest decline in the female population, and so unfortunately the story of Kashmir has been worst than Jammu.\n\n\n\nIt is a disgrace for all of us if the birth of girl child considered as a bad investment in future. She is considered to be consumer rather than a producer. Changing sex ratios among children are going to have a lasting impact on population dynamics in India, as most of today's births will survive for more than 60 years. The declining sex ratio is warning signal for the state government to wake up. The caution should be taken seriously; we are leading towards a crisis situation.\n\n\n\nIslam prohibits female infanticide. This is considered a serious crime of murder. Allah Says \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the female (infant), buried alive, is questioned, for what crime she was killed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Islam not only prohibits female infanticide, but it forbids all types of infanticide, irrespective of whether the infant is a male or female. It is mentioned in Surah Al-Anam chapter 6, Verse 151 (6:151).\n\n\n\nNow the question is what is needed to be done to overcome the situation. Stress should be laid on spreading awareness, gender equality and also on the keeping a check on alleged hospitals, who are involved in heinous practice of sex selection. Religious and political leaders should be involved for spreading awareness against the every kind of women discrimination and also engage local sarpanchs and panchs as they deal public at gross root level. Various ultrasound clinics in the State should be sealed at the earliest and initiated legal proceedings against people involved while violating the PNDT Act. It is the need of the hour to start a vigorous campaign against female infanticide so that people desist from such harmful activity.\n\n\n\nOnly concerted, persistent efforts to begin awareness drives, campaigns and education in the true sense of the word can ensure sustenance of laws that promise end to gender discrimination of any kind.\n\n\n\n(The author is Research Scholar Centre for the Study of Regional Development Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi)\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Updated at : Tuesday, November 6, 2012 24 hour ultimatum to govt: Panchayat members to protest in Delhi SRINAGAR, Nov 5: The All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference Monday warned to protest in New Delhi at Jantar Mantar if state government failed to respond in 24-hours to the threat given by militants.

XXXXXX Gastroenteritis outbreak in Bulbul Nowgam, Brakpora  SRINAGAR, Aug 8: Doctors have confirmed the outbreak of gastroenteritis at Bulbul Nowgam and Brakpora areas of Anantnag with more than 200 people hospitalised during last four days. The authorities have deputed a team of doctors to the area to control the situation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore than 200 people from the village have been hospitalized during last one week after they fell ill due to the consumption of contaminated water. Dozens of people are being hospitalised every day. The people complain of diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr Nasir Khan posted at local PHC. He said that 40 people were hospitalised today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides chlorination we are providing oral fluids and antibiotics to all the patients. So far we have treated and discharged nearly 250 people suffering from gastroenteritis. The situation seems to be now under control as less people are now visiting the hospital with the complaint,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr Nasir said. He said that the disease is water borne. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOutbreak of gastroenteritis is possible only due to the consumption of contaminated water. There can be no other reason for it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Officials said that the authorities this morning dispatched a team of doctors to the area to control the situation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides collecting samples of the water supplied to the villagers the doctors are educating the people about the do\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099ts to avoid suffering from water born diseases the doctors which came,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Dr Nazir Shahdad. Locals hold the PHE officials responsible for the outbreak of gastroenteritis in the area. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis all happened due to the impure and contaminated water supplied to the people by the PHE officials. The spring where from the water is supplied is without any cover allowing all the dusty and garbage into it. Besides outside laborers who work on brick kilns in the area also use the spring for all purposes including bathing and washing clothes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a local Sarpanch, Riyaz Ahmad Magray. However, officials of the PHE division, Anantnag said that the disease is not water borne and seems to have been caused due to some other reason. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe water supplied to the villagers was tested and found pure and fit for drinking. So there is no possibility of the outbreak due to water. The people seemed to have taken some juice leading to the outbreak of gastroenteritis in the area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said AEE, PHE division, Anantnag. On why the spring has not been covered he said that the lid of the spring was stolen some time back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a proper cover on the spring but that was stolen by thieves during night hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.

Actually, the government is trying to save its face by laying blame on the Corporations. Government should stop criticising us and focus on its own work,\" Leader of the House in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Subhash Arya said. A total of over 1,700 cases have been detected so far this year and three deaths have been confirmed by the MCD as of yesterday. There are other cases of suspected dengue deaths too being reported. Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit   had yesterday had criticised MCD for the rising number of dengue cases alleging that they were not doing anything to contain its spread. North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Azad Singh today condemned Dikshit's statement and instead held the state government responsible for the situation. \"The Delhi Government is politicising the issue and taking the spread of the vector-borne disease lightly. It is the government which is responsible for the spread of dengue as many drains of PWD were not desilted during the monsoon. \"Clogged drains and resulting water stagnation in the household periphery also have led to a high-level of mosquito breeding being detected in various areas,\" the NDMC Mayor said in a statement. In this regard, the three Mayors, Chairmen of Standing Committee and Leader of House of all three Corporations will meet the Lt Governor of Delhi and protest the allegation of state government, Arya said. Arya said that the city government has \"failed to make proper arrangement for treatment of patients suffering from dengue.\" He said 700 extra beds arranged by the city government in their hospitals for dengue patients are insufficient. Meanwhile, all three corporations have intensified their anti-dengue drives. \"SDMC seeing an alarming rise in the number of dengue cases had decided to cancel the holidays of DBC (Domestic Breeding checkers) workers and increased intensive fogging in its areas. We have also deploying more manpower for fumigation and doubled the number of medicines and fogging machine,\" Arya added. In a meeting called by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor today, the municipal body discussed dengue and chikunguniya cases in details. \"The east Delhi has detected 368 cases of dengue and the Mayor has directed preventive measures and treatment of patients on a war footing,\" EDMC Commissioner said.

According to Corporation Commissioner G. Latha, the fall comes even after the civic body had initiated measures to ensure that no dengue case goes unreported. And also after the Corporation had taken steps to reduce mosquito breeding sources, appointed workers on contract to do the work and worked extensively in high-risk areas.   In July, the Corporation prepared a micro plan to ensure that workers engaged for fogging, spraying of Bacillus thuringiensis and using abate followed a timetable, executed the work and received acknowledgement for the same from the residents. And the civic body had taken on contract 40 workers, eight each a zone. The eight workers in each zone functioned as a team, visited a ward a day and carried out the aforementioned operations. They also obtained the residents&#8217; signatures as a proof of their carrying out the work. And while obtaining the signatures the workers also obtained the mobile phone numbers, which the sanitary inspectors, zonal sanitary officers and other senior officials used for verification.   The team also carried out source reduction operations like removing coconut shells, unused tyres, plastic containers, etc. that stored water for mosquitoes to breed. Door-to-door campaigns were also conducted to create awareness among the public.   Ms. Latha said that the action the Corporation had taken had ensured that there were no new cases from the high-risk areas (see graphic).   The Corporation did not stop with that, though. It had also engaged multipurpose health workers from the office of the Deputy Director of Health Services to carryout source reduction operations. Plus, with the help of District Entomologist, the Corporation had also conducted training for its workers. It has planned to engage National Service Scheme volunteers to carry out awareness drive and had arranged for display of slides in cinemas.   Ms. Latha said that the Corporation had also constituted teams to tackle medical emergencies and address issues that follows monsoon.  ,&nbsp; dengue control measures   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  email:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Comments will be moderated 2.&nbsp; Comments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.  3.&nbsp; Please write complete sentences.

What's more worrisome is that that medical experts say the number of cases this time round has doubled since last year.  Five deaths and 1,355 cases of dengue have been reported so far according to the MCD. It is an increase of almost 50 per cent in the past one week.  The MCD has been carrying out fumigation activity in residential areas and across the city. While most of the dengue deaths have been from north Delhi, the administration is going all out to prevent more such cases and has even cancelled holidays of its workers.  Some workers have even been suspended. \"We have suspended two officials from the north corporation for failing to check the rising cases,\" said north Delhi mayor Azad Singh.  For dengue, it's a serious spurt compared to the last couple of years as 131 cases were reported in 2011 and only 19 cases in 2012.  Private hospitals  in the capital told CNN-IBN that the actual figures are much higher. They said at least 2,000 cases and at least 12 deaths have been reported so far.  Hospitals like the Gangaram hospital in New Delhi  have created a special ward to treat dengue patients. But they're still struggling with the shortage of beds.  Meanwhile, doctors have advised to watch out for symptoms like fever, breathlessness and pain in the abdomen. As a precaution, keep yourself covered and well hydrated.

Noting that \"no health programme for eradication of disease can succeed without the active cooperation and participation of citizens,\" the High Court bench of chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Pradeep Nandrajog dismissed a writ petition asking for the creation of an independent monitoring agency to supervise the implementation of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.  Advocate Gaurav Bansal had filed a plea alleging that the civic agencies and the government had failed to effectively implement the plan of action prepared by a government-appointed committee to prevent dengue.  \"Because of the rise in the number of dengue cases, there is an acute shortage of beds in most hospitals in the city,\" the plea argued, and sought direction for authorities to provide each dengue patient a bed and to bear the cost of treatment of dengue patients.  \"Direct the respondents (civic agencies and the health ministry) to provide NS-1 Antigen ELISA test kits to all private hospitals in NCR,\" the petition had said.  The court, however, dismissed the plea after noting that there was no reason to supersede the committee already constituted by the government.  \"We were satisfied that with the funds and manpower available, authorities are taking all steps for eradication of vector-borne diseases. Realising the ecological damage by use of chemicals such as DDT, bio-larvicide, which is eco friendly, is being used,\" the court said.  \"Major blame\" for the recurrence of the disease \"is on citizens of Delhi who are most uncooperative with the municipal authorities in maintaining hygiene\", the court observed. The bench also held that the issue was being looked into by experts. It said neither the petitioner nor the court were experts, and therefore had \"no constructive suggestions to offer\" to deal with the problem.

PTI had quoted NDMC mayor Azad Singh as saying that he had on Tuesday received reports of 11 new deaths from the zone. &ldquo;We received reports of 11 more deaths from the Shahbad Daulatpur area in the Rohini Zone today (Tuesday). We have already suspended the Deputy Health Officer and Malaria Inspector of the Rohini Zone with immediate effect, and also issued stern warning to the MHO,&rdquo; PTI quoted Singh as saying.   However, Mayank Sharma, additional commissioner of NDMC said that he had received reports of four deaths from the area, but it was not confirmed if they were due to dengue. He said these were sudden deaths, unlike what is seen in dengue. A review meeting of officials of Rohini zone has been called and the hospitals have been asked to submit reports in this regard. The two officials suspended include a deputy health officer and a malaria inspector of the zone. The official figure of conformed deaths is two as of last Monday. Of 1,355 cases recorded in the capital till Monday this year, Rohini zone has contributed the most with 291 cases so far. The commissioner of the corporation, who suspended the duo, also cancelled the leaves of medical and paramedical staff of all polyclinics falling under NDMC&rsquo;s jurisdiction. The corporation has ordered a number of corrective steps to check the menace and provide treatment to patients affected with the disease. Sharma said outdoor and indoor fogging has been intensified in Rohini and other zones. Also, the number of beds has been increased in Hindu Rao Hospital and Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for dengue patients. Besides, all the medical staff has been warned not to deny treatment to any dengue patient that comes to the hospitals. The corporation is also making attempts to provide treatment and diagnosis at the doorsteps of people in this zone. Two mobile dispensaries will be stationed in Shahbad Daulatpur and one each in Buddh Vihar and Kirari from Wednesday. Since BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a rally at Japanese Park in Rohini Zone on September 29, officials have been asked to intensify fogging in the areas near the venue.   25 killed as suicide bomber attacks church in Pakistan   Nairobi killings: Indian shot when he couldn't answer query on Islam   BJP to charge Rs 10 for Modi's B'lore rally   Too much time on social media may affect short-term memory   Tricks to mask grey hair   Bollywood&#039;s &#039;Raj&#039; in Russia continues   Apartment owners protest hike in water cess   Obama says he quit cigarettes for fear of wife   Nothing&#039;s askew   Kannada flavour to film fete   Dhoni&#039;s new hairstyle a rage among fans   Missing clock adds vintage years to Russell Market   Bus stops near traffic signals to be shifted shortly   Subscribe   Copyright 2008, The Printers (Mysore) Private Ltd., 75, M.G Road, Post Box 5331, Bangalore - 560001   Tel: +91 (80) 25880000 Fax No. +91 (80) 25880523 XXXXXX  Deccan Herald"}

This came in the backdrop of Health Minister Dr A K Walia, cracking the whip on the three municipal corporations for their \"complete failure\" to control the spread of dengue. Dr Walia wrote to the city's three mayors on Tuesday, citing several lapses including the spurt in dengue cases.  Dr Walia said the zonal health officers have failed to properly supervise field operations.  \"The Domestic Breeding Checkers (DBCs) are not working for more than 2-3 hours. Their attitude towards checking of domestic breeding is very casual. Neither do the malaria inspectors exercise effective supervision over their working nor do the health officers monitor the work of DBCs and malaria inspectors. This has led to inefficiency and inept handing of the situation, particularly mosquito-genic conditions,\" Dr Walia noted.   ... contd.

It is an increase of almost 50 per cent in the last four days, officials said today, adding that maximum cases are generally reported during September-end due to favourable conditions for breeding of mosquitoes. The number of cases has risen to 1,355 from 912 on September 19, a report released by the MCD said today. While the official death toll still stands at two, five persons have reportedly succumbed to the disease. For Delhi region till today, 1,326 dengue cases have been reported, while 29 have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other states, it said. The capital had witnessed large number of dengue cases in the 2010 with over 6000 cases being reported. In 2008, over 1300 cases were registered, 1153 in 2009, 1131 in 2011 and 2093 cases were reported last year. While figures for various corporations are North (663), South (351) and East (238), 48 cases were reported from regions in Delhi outside the jurisdiction of MCD and 26 cases in other category. Most number of cases were still reported from Rohini (291) and Narela (133) in the North Zone. Najafgarh (104), Karol Bagh (106) and Civil Lines (111) too posted over 100 figures, among other places. Reacting on the report, North Delhi and East Delhi municipal corporations Public Relations Officer Yogendra Singh Mann said, \"Fumigation and anti-larval routines are being carried out. Because of many construction activities going on in North region, more cases are being reported from there. \"We are regularly conducting sensitisation programmes and health camps are also being organised in different zones. Over 6000 cases were reported in 2010 due to large number of construction activities being carried out for the Commonwealth Games,\" Mann told PTI. Since, the municipal bodies follow the Elisa Test for diagnosis as per the central government guidelines, they have confirmed only two deaths while the the rest three cases are \"suspected dengue death cases\". The victims who have succumbed to the vector-borne virus confirmed by MCD are Phool Singh (47), a resident of Ashok Nagar area, and Priyanka of Pratap Nagar area who died on who died on September 5 and 9 respectively, the report said. The victims put under the suspected death cases include, Tarun Indooria (28), a contractual employee with the MCD, who was working as a Domestic Breeder Checker (DBC) and was the first death reported this year on September 1.

He had come to the city last month to spend time with his\nfriend. However, he ended up spending most of his vacation on a hospital bed instead.Four days after he landed, Khan got high fever. \u201cI thought it to be seasonal viral and popped in a paracetamol. The fever came down but was back soon after,\u201d says Khan.     \n\nHe saw a doctor. To his shock, Khan\u2019s platelet count had dropped to 75,000 per microlitre of blood  (normal is between 1.4 and 4 lakh). He was advised hospitalization.\n\n\u201cHonestly I had never bothered about my platelets before; but here I was, in the hospital with my heart skipping a beat every time the blood report showed a drop in the count,\u201d he recollects.\n\nKhan went to the closest government hospital - Guru Tegh Bahadur, where doctors asked him to wait as they admitted patients with count around 30,000.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to get my platelet count checked daily, and twice a day if the count dropped to 50,000,\u201d says Khan.\n\nMuch as he hoped the count did not touch 30,000, the report on the 4th day showed 45,000, and by evening it had dropped further to 25,000.\n\nKhan and his friend rushed to GTB, but panicked when doctors told them to keep at least two blood donors on a standby as he could need blood transfusion if the count dropped further.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank my friends enough. Till then I hadn\u2019t informed my family and had only friends for support, and within hours five of them turned up to donate,\u201d he said.\n\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/Images/Popup/2013/9/drug3.jpg\n\n\u201cThat night in the hospital was a sleepless one as I kept wondering what would the report say in the morning,\u201d he said.\n\nLuckily for Khan, the count had gone up from 25,000 to 33,000 and kept going up in the subsequent reports.\n\nKhan is not alone, in Delhi alone about 1000 people have officially tested positive for the mosquito-borne infection, with five deaths.\n\nThe number is three times higher if figures from private hospitals are believed. There\u2019s virtually an outbreak this year, and more virulent dengue-II strain is in circulation.\n\nAccording to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporations also, 74 cases of dengue have been reported in Mumbai just this month.In all, a total of 1,188 cases have been registered across Maharashtra till August this year.\n\nhttp://www.hindustantimes.com/Images/Popup/2013/9/22_09_pg21a.jpg\n\nDoctors say irregular rainfall over the past couple of weeks is responsible for the recent increase in the number of cases.\u201cI come across eight to 10 patients daily. Most come with viral fever symptoms and end up being diagnosed with dengue,\u201d says Dr Pratit Sambhani from Jaslok, Breach Candy and Bhatia hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue through its bite, breeds in stagnant water, biting only in the day,\u201d adds Dr Sambhani.\n\nSymptoms of dengue include fever accompanied by severe headaches, muscle and joint pains and rashes. Dengue is also characterised by abdominal pain, persistent vomiting and difficulty breathing. High-risk patients include children, elderly, pregnant women and immuno-compromised.\n\n\u201cWe are getting moderately ill dengue patients and there have been a few transfusions in our hospital in this month and our blood bank is under immense stress,\u201d said Dr Atul Gogia, vice-chairman, department of internal medicine, New Delhi\u2019s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.  \n\nIn Delhi, blood banks are making up to 20 times more platelets in a day than they normally do. Platelets start dropping rapidly as a typical side-effect of dengue may turn fatal in severe cases.\n\nPumping in platelets is the only way to save patients who start bleeding. The Indian Red Cross Society\u2019s blood bank in Delhi is separating platelets from up to 250 units of blood in a single day as compared to 12 till last month.\n\n\u201cMore than 20 of our technicians are working in triple shifts around-the-clock all seven days to ensure there is no shortage of blood components. We issue more than 80% in a day,\u201d said Dr Vanashree Singh, director blood bank, Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS).\n\nTo meet the excessive demand, IRCS is holding blood donation camps daily in Delhi NCR. Their mobile blood collection units are parked across the city and manage to collect up to 300 units of blood in a day.\n\n\u201cVoluntary donations meet 95% of our demand for blood, the rest 5% comes from replacement donors. If families can arrange a replacement donor nothing like it, but we aren\u2019t refusing anyone,\u201d said Dr Singh."}

There is no scientific answer to this question, but the use of papaya leaves has grown phenomenally in the capital in the past few weeks as the mosquito-borne disease sees a spurt, claiming at least five lives in the national capital. Over 900 cases have been reported here so far  The leaves, which are said to increase dipping platelet counts, are a much sought after product these days in Delhi nurseries - so much so that many residents told IANS that papaya leaves have been disappearing from their localities.  Vikram Saini, director of the Masjid Nursery at Pandara Road in south Delhi, said there are many people who come to buy the papaya plant.  \"We are getting a lot of queries. We have ample stocks,\" Saini said.  Y.C. Singh of Greenways Nursery at Lado Sarai said that at least 20-25 people come in a week to buy papaya plants.  \"The number of people coming to buy the plant is increasing. We sell a papaya seedling for Rs. 20, and the plant for Rs. 25,\" he said.  Doctors, however, said there are no scientific studies to prove that papaya plant leaves can cure dengue or increase the blood platelet count.  \"I have witnessed this phenomenon for the last 10 years. A lot of patients tell me that they have benefited but this is yet to be proved scientifically,\" Suronjit Chattejee of Indraprashtha Apollo Hospitals told IANS.  According to S. P. Byotra of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, 95 percent of dengue patients recover on their own as it is a self-limiting disease. \"It is only in five percent cases when patients suffer from hemorrhagic dengue fever or dengue shock syndrome that they have to be treated for a dipping platelet count,\" he added.  Patients, however, say they have found immense benefit from papaya leaves.  \"When my son was diagnosed with dengue last month, neighbours advised me to give him papaya leaves to increase the platelet count. It was miraculous,\" said Anuradha Gupta, a software professional and mother of two young boys.  Krishna Satpathy, who herself recovered from a bout of dengue fever, said papaya plant leaves are much in demand.  \"It proved beneficial for me. But when my maid also got dengue, I tried to get the leaves for her. But I couldn't find it in my neighbourhood. I had to approach my gardener, who went to a nursery in west Delhi to get it,\" said Satpathy, who lives in the Vasant Kunj area in south Delhi.  Satpathy said the leaves are to be first boiled and then crushed to extract the juice, which is subsequently drunk.  Preeti Chabra, senior consultant (Ayurveda) at Sir Ganga Rama Hospital, said: \"Yes, I have come across many people who are taking the juice of these leaves.\"  \"This looks like a new phenomenon. A lot of patients have told me that they are taking it. I am not stopping them. But it's not mentioned in the classical Ayurvedic text,\" Chabra told IANS.  Dengue symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain - and a skin rash that is similar to measles. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or dengue shock syndrome, characterised by dangerously low blood pressure.

Though the aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread dengue, cannot breed in low temperature, doctors have asked residents to follow precautions and to not allow water to stagnate in and around their dwellings.  According to the figures provided by the health department, while 191 dengue cases were confirmed during November 11-17, 81 cases were confirmed between November 18 and 24.   Dr Navjot Singh, professor of medicine at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said with the advent of winter, the cases had reduced up to 80% at the hospital. He expressed hope that dengue cases would be reported rarely in the next two weeks when the temperature would go down further.  District epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said, \"The life cycle of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes from egg till death is of one month. But due to fall in temperature, the breeding of these mosquitoes has almost ended.\" Dr Verma said though the number of dengue cases had gone down, residents should make sure that water was not collecting in containers.  \"The aedes aegypti mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, and could still breed at room temperature. Therefore, residents should continue to take precautions,\" he added. Meanwhile, seven new cases of dengue were confirmed from different city hospitals on Sunday. All patients are from Ludhiana district.  A total of 1,565 dengue cases have been reported since July. Of them, 977 patients belong to Ludhiana, 450 patients are from other districts and 138 patients are from other states.

The health minister said there is no single reason for the increase in cases. There could be various man-made and environmental factors, he said.  Azad said, \"The unprecedented growth in population, unplanned rapid urbanisation and inadequate waste management are reasons behind the outbreak.\"  Water supply mismanagement, gaps in public health infrastructure, increased mobility of population and poor infrastructure to monitor mosquito breeding were some other reasons cited by the health minister.  Kerala reported maximum 5,801 dengue cases followed by Karnataka (3,775), Tamil Nadu (3079) while 12 cases have come from Delhi till the end of July.  Toll has been highest in Kerala and Maharashtra, both reporting 19 deaths each. In Karnataka, 11 people have died while six have succumbed to the disease in Madhya Pradesh.  Dengue fever is a communicable disease and its symptoms include high fever for four to five days, usually accompanied by severe headache, pain in eyes, muscles and joints besides rashes. After the fever goes away, blood platelet count starts dipping. This is the most dangerous phase of the disease.

He said in view of upsurge and geographical spread of dengue to newer areas, a mid-term plan has been developed for prevention and control of dengue and many advisories have been issued from time to time to control and manage the outbreak of dengue. Field visits are carried out to assess the preparedness and to provide technical guidance to states, Azad said in a written reply to a query, adding that training is imparted to clinicians on case management as per GOI guidelines and to other health care functionaries on programme activities. For augmenting diagnostic facilities, the number of Sentinel Surveillance Hospitals (SSHs) with laboratory support has been increased to 347 across the country from 110 and linked with 14 apex referral laboratories with advanced diagnostic facilities for back up support for Dengue across the country, he said. The Minister said ELISA based IgM test kits are provided to these institutes through National Institute of Virology, Pune free of cost and a total of 1097 dengue diagnostic kits (1 Kit= 96 tests) have been provided by the Centre to SSHs during this year til July 22. He said ELISA based NS1 test has been provided for early detection of cases from 1st day of disease in addition to IgM test which can detect the Dengue case after five days of disease."}

XXXXXX  &nbsp;&nbsp;Fever in the tropics: aetiology and case-fatality - a prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital in South India  The objective of this study was to describe aetiology and case fatality of fever among inpatients in a tertiary care hospital in South India.  Methods:  This was an observational, prospective study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. Between July 2nd 2007 and August 2nd in 2007, adult patients admitted to the hospital with temperature > = 38.0[degree sign]C were included consecutively and followed during the hospitalisation period. Demographic and clinical data were collected and analysed for each patient. Associations were sought between death and various clinical and demographic variables.  Results:  One hundred patients were included, 61 male and 39 female. Mean age was 37.5 (range: 16 to 84) years. Mean fever duration was 5.4 (range: 0.1 to 42.9) following infectious aetiologies were recorded: tuberculosis (19%), lower respiratory infection (11%) including three with sepsis, urinary tract infection (10%) including three with E.coli sepsis, Plasmodium falciparum malaria (5%) including three patients with mixed P. vivax infection, scrub typhus (5%), typhoid fever (4%), cryptococcal meningitis (4%) including three HIV positive patients, endocarditis (3%) including two patients with Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, spleen abscess (2%), amoebic liver abscess (2%), sepsis undefined focus (1%), HIV infection (1%), hepatitis B (1%), rubella (1%), peritonitis (1%) and cholecystitis (1%).Non-infectious causes of fever were diagnosed in 15%, including systemic lupus erythematosus in four and malignancy in six patients. Cause of fever remained unknown in 13%.Case fatality during hospitalisation was 7% (7/100). Six of those who died were male. Five fatalities had bacterial sepsis, one spleen abscess and malignancy, and one had lymphomalignant and increasing age were significant risk factors for fatal outcome in unadjusted analyses, but only increasing age was a risk factor for death in adjusted analysis.  Conclusions:  A high number of tuberculosis and bacterial infections and a high case fatality rate from sepsis were found in this cohort, underlining the importance of microbiological diagnostics and targeted antimicrobial treatment in the management of fever. P. falciparum was identified in all malaria cases, and this rapidly fatal infection should be considered in patients with acute undifferentiated fever in India.

It is one of the four virus types that cause dengue, and can be lethal when it combines with any of the other types to infect humans. \n\n \n\n \"In Mumbai, 85% of the dengue cases can be attributed to the DEN-2 type of the virus,\" said Dr Jayanti Shastri, in-charge of the BMC's molecular diagnostic reference laboratory. Dengue has four types, commonly called DEN-1, 2, 3 and 4. \"Literature suggest that if the primary infection is by DEN-2 and a secondary one by DEN-4, there is a likelihood of the patient suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, both deadly manifestations of the disease,\" said Shastri, also head of the microbiology department at the BYL Nair Hospital.\n\n \n\n The additional director of the New Delhi-based National Vector Borne Disease Programme, Dr P K Sen, shared a similar observation. \"In recent years, we have found DEN-1 to be the commonly circulating type but that seems to have shifted to 2 now. Even in Delhi, the serological studies have found type 2 to be more predominant,\" he said. At the national level, dengue cases had jumped to a whopping 50,222 last year, an almost 166% increase from 2011.\n\n \n\n Mumbai, too, had recorded a 142% increase in dengue cases in 2012 when compared with the previous year. This year, one-third of the 727 dengue cases reported in the state were detected in the city. While, at the state level, 15 lives were lost to dengue this year, the city has not reported any fatalities. One death was reported from Mira Road on Thursday.\n\n \n\n Experts say the types of dengue viruses in circulation keep shifting with one type gaining strength over the other, or at times, two or more types circulating together. Scientists from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, observed that while DEN-1 almost remained the same in 50 years, there has been a genotype shift in DEN-2, which also coincided with the disease becoming more severe.\n\n \n\n Director of Haffkine Research Institute, Dr Abhay Chaudhary, said cross-infection or infections by two strains could be behind the severity of cases. Intensivist Dr Khusrav Bhajan, who consults with PD Hinduja Hospital, said, \"We have treated over 10 cases, some very serious. People should not delay seeing a doctor,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Statistics----\n\n \n\n Year-------- MUMBAI-------------- MAHARASHTRA ------------- INDIA\n\n \n\n 2013------- 250 (0) ----------------727 (15)----------------- 11,591 (41)\n\n \n\n 2012------- 1,008 (05) ---------------- 4,283 (118)---------- 50,222 (241)\n\n \n\n 2011-------416(3) ---------------- 1,138 (25)---------------18,860 (169)\n\n \n\n 2010-------116(3) --------------- 1,489 (5)---------------- 28,292 (110)\n\n \n\n *(Numbers in brackets indicate deaths)\n\n"}

Led by ecologist Mercedes Pascual of the University of Michigan, US, an international team of scientists including RC Dhiman from New Delhi based National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) found that lower sea surface temperatures in July in the tropical South Atlantic, west of Africa, were correlated with more rainfall over Kutch and Rajasthan in the monsoon. When the rainfall crossed a certain threshold, enough water was available for the malaria carrying Anopheles mosquito to breed. This in turn led to increased incidence of malaria in the following October and November. \"For this region of India and for this window of time in recent decades, the tropical South Atlantic appears to play a dominant role on rainfall and, through rainfall, on malaria,\" Pascual said, in a statement by the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.. In a retrospective analysis of malaria epidemics in the region between 1985 and 2006, the researchers found that July sea surface temperatures correctly anticipated nine out of 11 epidemic years and 12 out of 15 non-epidemic years. The study has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Since there is a four month gap between the colder temperature event and the onset of malarial epidemic, the study indicates that it can be used as a new forecasting tool should improve public health in the region. Planning for indoor insecticide spraying, one widely used control measure, could benefit from the additional lead time, for example. \"The climate link we have uncovered can be used as an indicator of malaria risk,\" Pascual said. \"On the practical side, we hope these findings can be used as part of an early warning system.\" After being nearly eradicated in India, malaria re-emerged there in the 1970s. An estimated 9 million malaria cases occur in India annually. The team analyzed epidemiological records of malaria incidence in northwest India and used statistical and computer climate models to test potential links between sea surface temperatures, monsoon rains in northwest India, and malaria epidemics there. They found that most malaria epidemics in northwest India, which peak in October or November, occur when rainfall in the preceding summer monsoon season equals or exceeds a rainfall threshold presumably required to support the growth of Anopheles mosquitoes."}

Latest data on the disease prevalence released by the health ministry also shows a significant rise in the incidence of dengue-from 18,860 cases in year 2011 to 49,606 in year 2012. About 1,700 dengue cases were reported from Delhi and four people died due to the disease last year. Scientists say dengue is becoming hyper-endemic-a term used when different strains circulate together or co-exist. This means that a person who has got infected with one kind of virus can still get infected by another serotype because he is not exposed to it; thus causing more cases. The dengue virus has four known strains. Of these the relatively milder strains include type-I, which is known as the classic dengue fever  , and type-III that causes high-grade fever without shock. The severe strains are: type-IV that leads to fever with shock and type-II, which causes thrombocytopenia or a drop in platelets, haemorrhagic fever, organ failure and dengue shock syndrome. \"The cases of malaria   have shown a dip across the country but dengue cases are picking up. The fatalities caused by the mosquito-borne disease have also gone up. In 2012, 247 deaths took place, compared to 169 fatalities reported in the previous year. In 2009 and 2010, the number of fatalities due to dengue was 96 and 110 respectively,\" said a senior health ministry official. He said that national guidelines for clinical management of dengue cases have been sent to the states for circulation and use in all hospitals. \"For augmenting diagnostic facilities, the numbers of sentinel surveillance hospitals with laboratory support has been increased from 110 to 347 across the country and linked with 14 apex referral laboratories for back up support,\" he added. In Delhi, officials said that a new variety of dengue-causing mosquito-Aedes albopictus-had been spotted last year which may be resistant to traditional forms of control mechanism such as fumigation and sprays.

XXXXXX  Thursday 14th February 2013  &nbsp;&#8250;&nbsp;  Subtle genetic changes found in dengue virus   Subtle genetic changes found in dengue virus   14th February 2013   Scientists have made a breakthrough which could lead to a better understanding of the dominant dengue virus strain in southern India.  They have found subtle genetic changes in the strain which they believe could be crucial to understanding disease severity.  Of the four strains of the dengue virus, DENV 3 has dominated recent outbreaks in the Indian sub-continent.  The genetic material of viruses belonging to each strain is not totally identical and minor variations can be traced to a common \u2018lineage\u2019.  Writing in Virology Journal, the team from the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Thiruvananthapuram, say that minor changes in the genetic material from one lineage can result in resemblance to viruses from another with such \u2018lineage shifts\u2019 linked to \u201cdramatic increases\u201d in dengue severity in many parts of the world.  The team compared the data with other Indian and global studies and reported a lineage shift (from lineage III to lineage IV) for the first time.  Easwaran Sreekumar, from the viral disease biology programme at the RGCB explained that lineage shift is reflected in changes to virus functions, such as increased or decreased virus multiplication, which can impact on the spread of the virus or the number of people infected.  S. Swaminathan, staff research scientist at the recombinant gene products group at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, said the RGCB study would be a step towards understanding the implications of the lineage shift, such as whether the new lineage causes more severe disease or is transmitted more by dengue mosquitoes.  &nbsp;   Comments   There are no comments for this article, be the first  Post your comment  Only registered users can comment.

It may not just be a bout with this year's flu. If you're a Western traveler, malaria and typhoid fever should top the list of diseases to discuss with your doctor when you return, especially following travel to Western Africa or India.   In a study of more than 80,000 returned travelers who sought medical care for illnesses, around 3,000 (4 percent) were affected by malaria, typhoid fever and other potentially life-threatening tropical diseases. Many would be surprised to know that not a single traveler contracted the highly contagious and lethal Ebola virus  , which is typically one of the tropical diseases most feared by travelers. The findings were published online today in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene .  \"While diagnosis and treatment of malaria and typhoid fever and many other tropical diseases   have improved greatly over the years, people still can die from them if they are not treated quickly after their symptoms begin,\" said University of Oslo researcher Mogens Jensenius, MD, PhD, who with his colleagues analyzed 15 years of data entered into the GeoSentinel surveillance network database. \"Doctors and nurses in Western countries need to be vigilant in considering these potentially life-threatening tropical infections in recently-returned travelers with fevers, and identify and treat them quickly.\"  Jensenius and fellow researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   (CDC), and several other universities throughout Europe, Israel, Australia and the United States looked at data from 82,825 ill travelers from Europe, North America, Israel, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The travelers sought care at clinics associated with GeoSentinel from June 1996 through August 2011 with illnesses contracted during travel to the tropics.  They found that 3,655 patients\u20144.4 percent of the total\u2014had one of 13 life-threatening diseases. There were a total of 13 deaths, 10 of which occurred in patients with malaria.  Of the diseases, the researchers found: Malaria\u2014caused by a parasite spread by the bite of infected female mosquitoes\u2014was by far the most common condition, making up 76.9 percent of the diagnoses  Fevers such as typhoid fever\u2014a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection contracted from contaminated food and water in areas with poor sanitation\u2014were found in 18.1 percent of the patients  Leptospirosis, the rare bacterial infection, which is usually caused by exposure to contaminated water, was diagnosed in 2.4 percent of the ill travelers  Malaria was mostly seen in travelers to West Africa, while most cases of typhoid fever were contracted by visitors to the Indian subcontinent. There were no cases of Ebola, Lassa fever or yellow fever among the more than 82,000 ill Western travelers included in the study, according to Jensenius and his fellow researchers.  \"We were quite surprised that these much-feared viral infectious diseases were completely absent,\" said Jensenius, who is also an infectious disease physician at Oslo University Hospital. \"People talk about them all the time, but our paper suggests that these are still very, very rare among travelers.\"  European clinics reported more than half of all of the life-threatening diagnoses. Jensenius said this may reflect the fact that most European (as well as New Zealand and Australian) GeoSentinel sites are located in hospitals whereas sites in the United States and Canada more often are travelers' clinics. \"In many of the North American GeoSentinel sites, they are more focused on pre-travel care,\" he noted, \"and don't see as many patients post-travel as we do in Europe.\"  Every year, an estimated 50 million Western travelers visit tropical countries in Central and South America, Africa, Oceania and Asia, and their numbers are expected to grow, according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). They may be tourists, adventure or eco-travelers on holiday or those traveling for business. But the group also includes an increasing number of immigrants returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives.  \"While tropical illnesses are rare in the Western world, these findings remind us that infectious disease pays no attention to geographic borders and affects the world at large,\" said David H. Walker, MD, president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and chair of the department of pathology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"\"Our membership includes an exceptional cadre of skilled physician-scientists who are civilian, military and governmental clinical experts in travelers' health and diagnosing and treating tropical infection and disease. It is noteworthy that three of the leading life-threatening diseases are neglected rickettsioses, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever rickettsioses.\" (For a list of physicians who specialize in Tropical Medicine, Medical Parasitology and Travelers' Health, go to: )  Each year, thousands of ill travelers seek health care at one of the 57 clinics associated with Geosentinel around the world when they return from their visits. Their anonymous diagnoses are uploaded to GeoSentinel's database to track disease trends among travelers. The GeoSentinel network was initiated in 1995 by the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), and is funded by ISTM and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track travel-related illnesses and deaths.  Researchers have published more than 20 studies using GeoSentinel data, but the new study focuses only on tropical travel and \"the life-threatening conditions that we as physicians need to identify rapidly,\" Jensenius said.  Travel Advice for Returning Immigrants and Western Travelers  Many of the malaria cases seen in the study were in immigrants returning to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives, the researchers discovered. Jensenius said these travelers may have battled malaria when they once lived in the tropics, and \"have this misconception that they are immune to the disease.\"  \"When they go back from Europe 10 years later, they believe they don't need the protection of a prophylaxis,\" he said. \"But that's wrong.\" Similar misconceptions might occur among returning immigrants to the Indian subcontinent, who believe they have immunity against typhoid fever .  The researchers advise all visitors to tropical regions to seek pre-travel advice on vaccinations and medications required for the countries they plan to visit, and while traveling take precautions to prevent insect bites, and drink bottled water.  Travelers who become ill with fever or flu-like illness while traveling or soon after returning home from high-risk areas should seek immediate medical attention and share their travel history with their physician, Jensensius cautioned. \"Nearly all the diseases identified in our paper presented with a fever and an incubation period of just a couple of weeks.\"   For more information and links to key travel medicine websites go to ASTMH Travel Medicine Resources: /UWGHW3   Journal reference:   American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene   The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene   Neglected tropical diseases burden those overseas, but travelers also at risk   Respiratory illnesses and dog bites a concern for travelers to China for 2008 Olympics   Half of those travelling internationally not aware of potential health risks   Step by step: Feature detection and combination in perceptual learning and object identification   Face the facts: Neural integration transforms unconscious face detection into conscious face perception   Do brain cells need to be connected to have meaning?

Health officials alleged that residents were adamant not to adopt precautionary measures to protect themselves from the dengue virus.  The district has reported around 30 positive cases, which were confirmed after the Maclisa test was conducted.  Most of the cases were reported from Ratan Nagar, Tafjalpura, Tripuri, Anand Nagar, Badunagar Colony, Lehal Colony, Charan Bagh and Ajit Nagar.  A senior official in health department said people had totally failed to take serious note of directions of the health department.  \"The inspection teams have washed out the mosquito larva laden water from the coolers of residents,\"he said.  \"It's not possible for us to control the outbreak of the disease until people cooperate with us,\"said another official.  District health officer Harish Malhotra said residents' cooperation was needed to help avoid the disease becoming an epidemic.  \"Inspecting teams have been directed to spread awareness among people regarding taking precautions and recognise symptoms of fever,\"he said.  Besides carrying out gammexane spray in 60 houses in different colonies, they had taken 138 blood samples of suspected cases, which will be sent to microbiology laboratory at Government Rajindera Medical Hospital for IGM Maclisa test.  Malhotra added that dengue isolation wards had been established in civil hospitals across the district, and civic bodies of various towns and cities had been instructed to carry out fogging in the affected areas.  Principal of Government Rajindera Medical College KD Singh said the hospital was fully equipped to tackle the suspected as well as confirmed dengue cases.  \"As many as 81 suspected cases has been admitted in the hospital out of which only 13 patients were confirmed,\"he said, adding that the confirmed cases were treated successfully and have been discharged.

It shows no signs of abetting with government hospitals in many parts of the state receiving scores of patients every day.  As many as 153 and 32 patients are undergoing treatment at Sriram Chandra Bhanja Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack, about 25 km from here, and Capital Hospital at Bhubaneswar, respectively. Many of them were hospitalized this week.  The mosquito-borne disease which has spread to 26 of the state&#8217;s 30 districts has so far left five people dead. All the deaths occurred last month.\u00a0  Three deaths were reported from the industrial district of Angul, coastal Kendrapada and Bhadrak district reported one death each, he said.  What is dengue?  Dengue fever is a communicable disease and its symptoms include high fever for four to five days, usually accompanied by severe headache, pain in eyes, muscles and joints besides rashes. After the fever goes away, blood platelet count starts dipping. This is the most dangerous phase of the disease.  How to prevent dengue?  Here are a few simple and practical tips to keep dengue at bay:   Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to bite humans during the day and their most common breeding grounds are manmade containers. Therefore, it is advisable to not have any stagnant water around. Remember to clean out empty flower pots and not to over water potted plants. If the container that contains water cannot be emptied, remember to cover it well when not in use.  A natural method to keep mosquitos at bay is to plant\u00a0 tulsi \u00a0  \u00a0near your window. The plant has properties that do not allow mosquitoes to breed.  Using camphor as a repellent also works wonders. Light camphor in a room and close all the doors and windows. Leave it this way for about fifteen to twenty minutes to have a mosquito free environment.  Make sure your window and door screens do not have any holes. If so, block those areas properly to eliminate mosquitoes.  If someone at home is ill with dengue, try to not let the mosquitoes bite them or others in the house.  Always sleep under a mosquito net.  If you use a cooler remember to empty out and clean the water tray regularly, even when not in use.  A natural method to keep mosquitos at bay is to plant \u00a0 tulsi  \u00a0\u00a0  Using camphor as a repellant also works wonders. Light camphor in a room and close all the doors and windows. Leave it this way for about fifteen to twenty minutes to have a mosquito free environment.\u00a0  Dengue is a\u00a0completely\u00a0preventable\u00a0condition; all you have to do is take a few steps to keep yourself and your family safe.\u00a0   Post your comment here   You may use these HTML   &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;abbr title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;acronym title=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;cite&gt; &lt;code&gt; &lt;del datetime=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;q cite=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;strike&gt; &lt;strong&gt;   Odisha dengue update: 50 new cases   Copyright &#169; 2013 .com Disclaimer XXXXXX  India.Com Health"}

Dengue fever is a communicable disease and its symptoms include high fever for four to five days, usually accompanied by severe headache, pain in eyes, muscles and joints besides rashes. After the fever goes away, blood platelet count starts dipping. This is the most dangerous phase of the disease.  How to prevent dengue?  Here are a few simple and practical tips to keep dengue at bay:   Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to bite humans during the day and their most common breeding grounds are manmade containers. Therefore, it is advisable to not have any stagnant water around. Remember to clean out empty flower pots and not to over water potted plants. If the container that contains water cannot be emptied, remember to cover it well when not in use.  A natural method to keep mosquitos at bay is to plant\u00a0 tulsi \u00a0  \u00a0near your window. The plant has properties that do not allow mosquitoes to breed.  Using camphor as a repellent also works wonders. Light camphor in a room and close all the doors and windows. Leave it this way for about fifteen to twenty minutes to have a mosquito free environment.

Be it malaria, dengue or chikungunya, there has been an alarming spike in the number of vector-borne diseases reported in the state since 2008. \"Between August and September this year, there has been a four-fold increase in dengue cases, compared to the same period last year,\" said Dr Vihang Mazumdar, head of Baroda Medical College, who was one of the speakers at a conference organised by Gujarat's Health and Family Welfare Department on Tuesday. In 2012, there were around 10,000 dengue cases. This rose by about 48 percent to over 19,000 cases in October. \"Compared to six deaths due to dengue last year, the numbers rose to 12 in 2013,\" Mazumdar said while speaking on the diseases that were prevalent in Gujarat. Quoting government figures, the official said the number of chikungunya has risen 16-fold in Gujarat since 2008. \"There were just 53 cases in 2008. This has risen to 847 cases (till October 2013) this year,\" Mazumdar said. The health expert from Vadodara also pointed out that the cases of malaria also increased by about 34% as compared to the cases registered in 2008. \"The cases increased from 50,884 cases in 2008 to 76,246 cases in 2012,\" he told a gathering of doctors and experts from the health sector. \"These numbers are, however, only a fraction of the actual number of cases as most of the cases related to vector-borne diseases that go to private hospitals are not reported,\" Mazumdar remarked, adding that the actual numbers would be 4-5 times of the reported figures. Talking about Gujarat-specific diseases, Mazumdar pointed out that the cases of leptospirosis, which is widely prevalent in South Gujarat, have decreased from 918 cases in 2011 to 308 cases in 2013.

There has also been a sharp drop in the number of reported malaria cases, which has fallen from 15 lakh in 2009 to 10 lakh in 2012, according to provisional figures available with the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP), an agency that monitors viral diseases. Experts say that despite the risk of underreporting , the numbers prove that the severity of the disease is definitely coming down.\n\nIn the past year, barring a few states, the mortality numbers have also dropped. But in Gujarat, for instance, the number of malaria-related deaths has gone up to 19 in 2013, from 16 in 2012.\n\n\"In the past decade, there has been a lot of work done to prevent malaria: the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (2.25 million), use of improved anti-malarial or artemisinin-based combination therapy and easy access to Rapid Diagnostic Test have helped in keeping the disease under check, \"said GS Sonal, additional director of NVBDCP. He added that if the numbers begin to go up, it's going to be a matter of concern. The most severe form of malaria is caused by the plasmodium falciparum virus which thrives in stagnant water.\n\nThe malaria caused by falciparum virus affects 65% of India's cases and possible deaths. Along with TB, HIV, AIDS and malaria are the main worries of developing countries, and have attracted huge funds from philanthropic institutions. Malaria has got close to. 600-crore funding from the Global Fund, the largest donor that helps fight diseases like HIV and tuberculosis also. The government , through NVBDCP, has chipped in about.\n\n30 crore for combating malaria. However, despite these efforts, there is some scepticism about the numbers, since state governments often tend to under-report instances of the disease, and there's no way of cross-checking them.\n\n\"There are declines, but they have not been significant in many places. In many states, you will find a surgeon or obstetrics treating malaria cases rather than appointing experts from the field, \"says a researcher from the National Institute of Malaria Research."}

According to health ministry data, the number of dengue cases has been steadily rising since 2008 \u2014 when the count was 12,561 \u2014witnessing a dip only in 2011. The number of deaths due to the disease has increased from 80 in 2008 to 138 this year, although it is far lower than 242 recorded last year. Health specialists attribute the steady increase in dengue cases to a number of factors, including heavy rains, intense construction activity in cities and a better surveillance system that enables detection of more cases. There is, however, a silver lining in this grim tale. The dengue morbidity trend, or the proportion of deaths in comparison to the number of cases, has been coming down. The dengue fatality rate was 3.3% in 1996 when the number of cases reported was 16,517. This has dropped to 0.5% in 2012 and 0.2% in 2013. \"This is encouraging. The low case fatality rate indicates that surveillance is increasing and dengue patients are being diagnosed and treated before it is too late,\" a senior health ministry official said. India is in category A countries, along with Thailand and Indonesia, where dengue is a major public health problem and a leading cause of hospitalization and death. However, data from states appears to indicate that dengue cases continue to be under-reported. For instance, according to records of the Jharkhand malaria office, this year 82 cases of dengue have been confirmed. Central data records no cases for this year, revealing a gross mismatch in figures. State health officials say dengue cases and deaths are confirmed by the government on the basis of the Eliza test report. Many districts do not have Eliza machines for dengue tests and are dependent on laboratories in other parts of the state. Health workers also acknowledge that at times they are faced with a shortage of Eliza kits for the test. Health ministry says there is now a network of 394 sentinel surveillance hospitals across the country for case detection and treatment, as compared to 110 in 2007. There are 14 apex referral laboratories with advanced diagnostic facility for back up support of regional centres. But these appear to be woefully short of what's needed.

It is an annual plague in India and a hidden epidemic, say experts. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease with no known cure or vaccination that strikes fear into the citizens of New Delhi when it arrives with the monsoon rains \u2013 just as the scorching heat of the summer is subsiding. Hospital wards are overwhelmed and tales abound of deaths and cases while New Delhi authorities have insisted that only 3,500 have fallen sick this year, with only five fatalities. \u201cI took him first to a government hospital. I was shocked to see that it was packed with dengue patients. There was not even a single bed available,\u201d said Mr Awwal\u2019s mother, Mehrunissa. She has been treating him at their home, giving him multivitamins, paracetamol and water as he lies on the floor with two pillows and a bedsheet but no mattress. In a sign that this year\u2019s outbreak could be as bad as a record-breaking 2010, the city\u2019s largest public hospital, Hindu Rao, said this month that it had suspended all routine surgeries to make room for more dengue patients. The Delhi government has blamed prolonged monsoons for the increase in infections, but said it has added beds at hospitals and increased resources for spraying insecticides to tackle the mosquito menace. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to worry about, there is no crisis,\u201d Charan Singh, the additional director of Delhi health services, said, dismissing allegations that the city of 17 million underreports the problem. \u201cIt is a lot of hype going on ... The government is in action and we report all cases according to international guidelines.\u201d The virus affects two million people across the globe annually, with the number of cases up 30 times in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organisation. Transmitted to humans by the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, it causes high fever, headaches, itching and joint pains that last about a week. There are four strains, one of which can cause fatal internal bleeding. In India, cases have increased sharply over the past five years, there have been 38,000 so far in 2013, but doctors say these numbers only capture part of the problem. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India\u2019s most prestigious public hospital, doctors were overwhelmed by patients. Medics said they were seeing 60 new dengue patients a day, an influx they suspected was not reflected in the official figures. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to create panic or because they don\u2019t want to be blamed, but if they hide, people won\u2019t know how bad the situation is,\u201d said a doctor. Sandeep Budhiraja, internal medicines director at the private Max Healthcare hospital in Delhi, blamed city authorities for failing to be prepared and said cases would only decline with the onset of winter next month. \u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic that hits the country every year, yet there is never any preparedness by officials. It just keeps getting worse,\u201d said Dr Budhiraja, adding that Max had opened its fever wards to accommodate dengue patients. While dengue is painful and debilitating, death is usually rare but patients are vulnerable to other fatal viral infections during or shortly after the time of illness. There is still no specific treatment, but last year French healthcare giant Sanofi Pasteur said it would begin tests for a dengue vaccine in India before making it available internationally by 2015. A leading Brazilian biomedical research institute, Butantan, also said last month it was working on a dengue vaccine that they hoped would be ready by 2018. British firm Oxitec has also created genetically modified sterile male Aedes mosquitoes \u2013 what they call \u201cbirth control for insects\u201d \u2013 but met with severe criticism for releasing unnatural species into the environment. The only defence so far is preventive steps, like removing stagnant water near residential areas, spraying insecticide, applying mosquito repellent and wearing long sleeves and trousers. Many victims in India gulp down papaya-leaf juice believing it to boost blood-platelet levels, which are decimated by the virus. \u201cIt is a largely preventive, self-limiting virus, but we still hardly invest in research for treatments,\u201d said Dr Budhiraja from Max Healthcare. \u201cThere are only some vaccines being tried out, but no luck yet.\u201d * Agence France-Presse"}

Of the six deaths attributed to the mosquito-borne viral disease this year, five occurred last month. \n\n\n\n Experts are certain dengue continues to be worrisome. It started with 32 cases in June, almost doubled to 66 in July and quickly rose to affect 87 in August. The leap in September, though, was due to a probable viral built-up in certain city pockets, experts told TOI. Most cases as well as deaths were recorded from the highrises of western suburbs, from Bandra to Borivli. Goregaon, in particular, was the epicentre this year for reasons yet to be clearly diagnosed. \n\n\n\n Civic statistics showed within September, most cases were seen in the last week, suggesting the viral onslaught may not be over with the rains. A state official said, \"Though dengue cases have been pouring in from all over the country, we have reported the highest number of deaths at 31. The reasons could be both\u2014more people getting affected or better reporting than by the other states. The worst may not be over for us yet given that Maharashtra's peak dengue season begins post-September.\" Nearly 3,000 dengue cases were reported from the state. \n\n\n\n Intensivist Dr Khushrav Bhajan, who consults with P D Hinduja Hospital in Mahim, said dengue patients are outnumbering malaria's, but not many are coming with complications. \"We have also treated an unusual case where a patient came with mixed infection of dengue as well as malaria. Such cases are tricky as both can bring down the platelet count rapidly. This patient recovered with timely intervention,\" he said. \n\n\n\n At the national level, too, doctors are afraid dengue is creating havoc but not enough to shake the health ministry. The death toll recently crossed 100 while affected people totalled 38,000. Yet, Dr A C Dhariwal, director of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, ironically called the trend \"predictable\". \n\n\n\n \"The incidence is predictable as the virus spread is supplemented by the long rainfall and circulation of DEN-2.\" Infection with the Den-2 strain of dengue has globally come to be associated with increased severity. \n\n\n\n On the other hand, malaria, also mosquito-borne, appears to be under control with not a single casualty. Fever and gastroenteritis, though, seem to be on the upswing with nearly 9,000 hospitalizations. H1N1 infection is up with 14 cases being reported. \n\n\n\n"}

In Ahmedabad, senior IPS officer Rahul Sharma's wife Sumita died in August this year, one of three victims out of 900-odd cases. And in Mumbai, the death of filmmaker Yash Chopra has created greater panic than ever that the disease can afflict anyone. Greater Mumbai has had 500 cases this year, out of over 2,600 statewide including 31 who have died.  National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme officials have counted more than 32,000 cases of dengue and 100 deaths in the country this year. Kerala has had the highest number of cases at nearly 7,000. The fatality rate is not as bad as it was last year, when 240 of 50,000 cases died across the country. Dr A C Dhariwal, director of NVBDCP, points out there are guidelines on combating the disease and there is no cause for panic.  Dengue does, however, present fresh challenges. It is no longer a cyclical problem, though that depends on where the outbreak occurs. The virus transmits itself round the year in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, while it has remained a seasonal phenomenon in the northern, central and eastern states, NVBDCP officials say. In the latter areas, transmission tends to pick up in the post-monsoon months from September to December. Dengue has become endemic with even places like Samba in Jammu having reported an outbreak; last year it was Palighat in Arunachal Pradesh, says Dr Kalpana Baruah, NVBDCP joint director.   ... contd.

This has been done after noticing fever cases initially identified as dengue being later confirmed as viral fever. As many as nine dengue cases were reported till date, including five from neighbouring districts. Chief medical officer Padmakar Singh said that ELISA test confirms whether the patient is suffering from dengue or viral fever. \"If the platelets counts are less during kit investigation, it could not be confirmed as dengue case,\" said doctor. Patient must go for ELISA test to confirm the exact status. Ordinary fever cases were diagnosed as dengue cases. The senior health authorities asked for conducting ELISA test at the medical college. Only nine cases, including five from neighbouring districts were confirmed as dengue. Doctors claim every year cases of dengue emerge as one of the most troubling health problems during this season. As per World Health Organization (WHO), about 34% of dengue cases across the globe were reported in the country. The disease is caused by the bite of an infected mosquito called aedes egypti. The mosquito breeds in water collections in ornamental pots in houses, indoor money plant containers, open water storage tanks and overhead tanks which are not covered. A senior health officer pointed out that the people should take precautions to check the spread of the disease. The patients should visit the nearest health centers to ease confusion regarding dengue. Cases of dengue had risen across the nation this year, with data showing an 80% rise in the disease till July 31 as compared to last year. As per latest health ministry report, the country has recorded 15,983 dengue cases so far in 2013 as compared to 8,899 cases in the corresponding months last year. Kerala reported most dengue cases at 5,801, followed by Karnataka (3,775), Tamil Nadu (3,079) and Maharashtra (961) till July-end.

However, there is some respite as the number of dengue deaths have declined to 56 from 76 in 2012 during the equivalent period.  The southern state of Kerala has reported the highest number of dengue positive cases, recording a total of 5,801 cases with 19 deaths. Karnataka, including Bangalore, comes second with a total of 4,782 dengue positive cases and 12 deaths since January this year till 26 August (Monday). Other states including Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have also reported dengue cases.   Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that causes flu-like illness that spreads through the bite of the Aedes aegypti   mosquito. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), the incidence of dengue has raised 30 times over the last 50 years. A study published by Nature journal has reported that as many as 390 million people across the globe could be infected with dengue annually.  Researchers have found that India has the world&#039;s highest dengue cases, with about 34 percent of all cases occurring in the country. Persistent rain and water logging (which provides breeding grounds for the insect) are the main factors that have led to the rise in dengue cases this year.  Dengue Symptoms  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High Fever (40&deg;C/ 104&deg;F)  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe headache  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain behind the eyes  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vomiting  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nausea  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muscle and joint pains  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swollen glands or rash  The infection that causes dengue occasionally develops into severe dengue, which is the leading cause of deaths among children in Asian and Latin American countries.

How to prevent dengue fever  The best way to prevent the transmission of dengue virus is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes.  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats such as open water containers near the garden or balcony, broken pots, tires and tubes.  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proper disposal of solid waste.  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clean and cover water storage containers on a weekly basis.  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use long trousers/pants and long sleeved shirts during the monsoon.  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use mosquito repellants or net, window screens and insecticide treated materials.

Gogoi held an urgent meeting and asked the officials to make people aware about the disease. He said two people have already died in the state while several others were undergoing treatment in various hospitals. He asked the department to ensure people infected with the dengue virus receive proper treatment. \u2018Public awareness is the most important to stop the disease,\u2019 said Gogoi while issuing instructions to go for regular fogging in all the 31 municipal wards of the city and across the state. Earlier, Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed to the people not to panic over reports of dengue outbreak in Assam, particularly in Guwahati. \u2018While two have died, 43 people who are suffering from dengue are admitted to different hospitals of the state,\u2019 said Sarma. He, however, reiterated the situation was not alarming. \u2018Last year, over 900 people were detected with dengue in Assam. In other cities like Bangalore, dengue virus infects thousands every year,\u2019 he said. The minister said besides Guwahati, cases have been reported from Tinsukia, Sonitpur, Barpeta and other places. \u2018Of the 43 confirmed cases, 35 are in Guwahati,\u2019 he said. What is dengue? Dengue fever is a communicable disease and its symptoms include high fever for four to five days, usually accompanied by severe headache, pain in eyes, muscles and joints besides rashes. After the fever goes away, blood platelet count starts dipping. This is the most dangerous phase of the disease. How to prevent dengue? Here are a few simple and practical tips to keep dengue at bay: Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are known to bite humans during the day and their most common breeding grounds are manmade containers. Therefore, it is advisable to not have any stagnant water around. Remember to clean out empty flower pots and not to over water potted plants. If the container that contains water cannot be emptied, remember to cover it well when not in use. A natural method to keep mosquitos at bay is to plant\u00a0 tulsi \u00a0 \u00a0near your window. The plant has properties that do not allow mosquitoes to breed. Using camphor as a repellent also works wonders. Light camphor in a room and close all the doors and windows. Leave it this way for about fifteen to twenty minutes to have a mosquito free environment.

He said, \"In several cases, a patient showing positive result in ELISA kit test, has shown negative result in ELISA Reader Test.\" He suggested all private test centres to refer all suspected cases to sadar hospital for collection of blood sample so that they could be sent for confirmation of the disease. He said the malaria department has completed fogging in 58 suspected villages in Saran district.\n\n \n\n \"As far as fogging in townships goes, the civic bodies concerned have been requested to do the needful,\" said Srivastava.

The five patients suffering from dengue were identified as Ramesh Singh (Bhagwan Bazaar), Sona Devi (Chhapra marketing yard), Ashok Kumar (Sabalpur-Sonepur), Munna Kumar (Bhairopur- Ekma) and Arif (Pyarepur-Baniapur).\" Out of these five persons, Ramesh resides in Jharkhand, Munna in Odhisa and Arif in Delhi, said Srivastava adding only two cases have been found from Saran district. When asked why only 58 villages were selected for fogging, Dr Srivastava said, \" From five villages dengue suspected cases were reported while the rest 53 villages were selected as cases of Japanese Encephalitis and unknown encephalitis were reported from there in 2012.\"\n\n \n\n Dr Srivastava said mosquito causing dengue is commonly known as Tiger mosquito as they bear the impression of tiger over their wings, legs etc and its zoological name has been 'Ades Agyptii'. Regarding symptoms of the disease, he said, \"Patients complain of bone breaking pain, retro-orbital pain and headache followed by high fever and gradual loss of platelets.\" He suggested use of paracetamol and hydration with maintenance of normal blood pressure.\n\n"}

Each of them carrying children, some as young as a few months complaining of chronic cold, fever, and, increasingly, upset stomachs. Already, the bitter cold has proved fatal, claiming the lives of several children in the camp. ( Donate blankets and dry ration ) But inside the tent, a team of volunteer doctors from Kerala warn of a new menace. Dr Samir Zainal Abedin told us that he has seen 10-15 cases for diarrhoea. He says this figure might go up. In a worrying conclusion, he says \"a senior medical officer has come and told us that this is a kind of viral diarrhoea and can spread very fast.\" \u00a0 He says \"the main cause is unhygienic surroundings, environment. Mainly flies, water mainly.\" Everywhere in the camp, there are swampy, garbage infested pits. Not far from them, children sift through the dirt looking for tiny pieces of firewood that will help them stay warm. The few sources of clean water for a thirsty camp come from hand pumps, in one case, not too far from a stagnant pool. To service a camp of 3,000 people, a single tanker is sent by the government. It is parked unattended, as children drink from it directly. It is in keeping with the state government's policy of keeping an arms-length distance from these camps, which it sees as encroachments. The government claims there is no threat any more in the villages, and that those living in camps must return. Only people from nine villages, worst-hit by the riots of last September, are allowed to not go back. But they have been given a compensation to shift out of the camps and find residence elsewhere. The people of the camps contest this, saying there is still an atmosphere of tension in their villages, and they will not return. In the absence of the government, the Islamic charities running the Malakpur camp say they have been stretched to breaking point. Its convenor Gulshad Choudhury says they need a full time government doctor, clean water, and waterproof tents. \u00a0 With a new diarrhoea outbreak looming, the icy cold, which has already claimed lives of the very young, still remains a threat. One of the last visitors to the medical tent was a four-month-old baby, crying in distress. \"She has severe chest infection,\" Dr Abedin told us. \"It is not looking good.\""}

Samples of the meal were collected by police. \"All of them, except two, were discharged after preliminary treatment at the hospital,\" he said.

XXXXXX  Cutbona's dengue cases rise, locals demand action  The writer has posted comments on this article   VELIM: In view of the rising number of suspected dengue   cases in Cutbona, Velim sarpanch Melvyn Sanches has demanded that state health officials carry out fogging in the entire locality spread across 2-3km. Health department officials, for their part, have identified barrels and storage tanks where larvae appear to be breeding as the possible cause of the suspected breakout. With two more persons -ward member Veena Cardozo   and her son-admitted to a private hospital for blood tests and a medical check-up, the total number of people suspected to be affected with dengue in the area has risen to nine. Health officials told TOI that they will take necessary action. Sanches said he will also write to authorities to ensure that workers from other states staying in the locality are vacated immediately to bring the situation under control. He claimed the two fresh cases have shown that things are not under control. Locals from the Cutbona area of Velim went around the locality to ensure there's no water storage or accumulation. They also opened a damaged sluice gate releasing the stagnated water. Health official Lioneta D'Silva said people in the area have offered mosquitoes the perfect breeding site. \"People have stored water in barrels and have left them open. Unused water was found in many utensils. This has contributed to the spread of dengue,\" said D'Silva. President of the Cutbona Boat Owners Union  , Seby Cardozo, suggested that net mending and bathing facilities for the workers should be provided at the jetty itself in the acquired land. He appealed to boat owners to also shift their workers as well as the net mending activities from the locality inhabited by locals to the jetty. He added that boat owners and the union are open to screening of the workers employed on their fishing vessels.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Ranchi   Indian Council of Medical Research team visits Bokaro to assess dengue cases  The writer has posted comments on this article   (ICMR), Ranchi visited the district to assess the situation following dengue outbreak here. In past couple of months, 22 patients were reportedly admitted in hospitals after they complained of symptoms similar to that of dengue. However five dengue cases have been confirmed so far. However no casualty has occurred as majority of the patients were cured and released. According to district malaria officer, Anil Poddar, the health department had collected 11 blood samples and sent them for test in RIMS, of which reports confirmed five cases of dengue. Of them, three are residents of Radha Gaon, a village situated near Bokaro Railway Station. The ICMR team comprising senior research scientist Mahua Dasgupta, Dr Sana Farha and a laboratory technician visited Radha Gaon and Bokaro General Hospital   to meet the patients. They also collected blood samples of 22 people in Radha Gaon and five patients in BGH. Poddar said the team was satisfied with the preventive action taken by health department officials in the sensitive areas. Besides taking an initiative to make the villagers aware of precautionary measures, Dasgupta also checked with the health officials if chemicals were regularly sprayed at mosquito breeding sites in the area. She asked villagers to remove stored water from their houses and surroundings to keep mosquitoes at bay. Poddar said the BGH management, where majority of patients were admitted and cured, is sending daily report to health department of the dengue patients. However the government hospitals are equipped with testing kits to handle dengue patients. Apart from Bokaro, suspected cases from Dhanbad are also flocking BGH with similar symptoms.

While unofficial toll is stated to be over 15 with as many as 12 in the SCB Medical College and Hospital alone, the Health and Family Welfare Department on Friday confirmed five deaths in August. Angul accounted for three deaths while one each was from Bhadrak and Kendrapara. Apart from one death in Apollo Hospital in Bhubaneswar, all the others succumbed while being treated at the SCBMCH.  The confirmation was made following a high-level review of the dengue related deaths at the SCBMCH under Director of Health Services and Nodal Officer for National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVDCP) Dr M Pradhan on Wednesday. The Health Department has, however, associated the dengue deaths with other co-infections and complications.  Meanwhile, dengue cases continued to soar across the State with as many as 80 cases testing positive on Friday. Jajpur had the highest number of positive cases at 28 followed by Khurda at 16 and Cuttack at 15. Puri reported six cases, Angul and Dhenkanal four each and Balasore and Kendrapara two each. Total number of dengue cases reached 2,867 on Friday.  According to experts, the situation is likely to aggravate as the period till November is considered to be the peak season for the outbreak.  The post-monsoon period with its climate and temperature is considered to be ideal for breeding of the aedes egypti vectors.

Speaking to The Hindu here on Wednesday, Dr. Sajjanshetty said the water-logged roads and other places in the city, because of incessant rain in July and first week of August, have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. He said all the 13 patients were responding to treatment. Meanwhile, there has been a sharp fall in the incidence of malaria in the district. As against the 628 cases reported last year, only 251 cases of malaria were reported in the district this year. Dr. Sajjanshetty attributed this to the change in treatment procedures and increased surveillance in identified hotspots. The ASHA workers have been supplied with rapid diagnostic kits that enable early detection and treatment of malaria. Besides, he said fishlings have been released to 2,500 permanent water bodies to eradicate mosquitoes. Posts vacant To a question, Dr. Sajjanshetty said 45 per cent of the posts of medical officers were vacant. Also, there was a very high percentage of vacancy of specialist doctors. Of the 266 sanctioned posts of doctors in government hospitals in the district, only 146 were filled. Similarly, of the total sanctioned posts of 93 specialists, only 24 were working and 69 were vacant. There was also 30 per cent vacancy of paramedics in the district, he said. Dr. Sajjanshetty said the government has given its sanction to establish a 100-bed maternity and child health hospital in the now abandoned Government Leprosy Reconstruction and Protection Centre in the outskirts of the city. A proposal to release Rs. 3.5 crore for the hospital has been submitted to the government, he added."}

XXXXXX SRINAGAR, Aug 26: The water samples collected by the team of doctors from Brakpora area of Anantnag, after the break out of gastroenteritis in the area, have been found highly contaminated during the laboratory analysis. At least 300 hundred people have fallen ill after the outbreak. Since the gastroenteritis is a water borne disease, the doctors had collected two water samples for testing one from the tap water and the other from the pond water where from the water was supplied to several villages of the area. The district administration, sensing the gravity of the situation, had stopped the water supply to the people of the area from all the sources. Water was being supplied to them and pressed into service the tankers for water supply. The analysis report provided by the sources in the office of Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Anantnag, suggests that the water is highly contaminated. The report, ironically, does not describe the water unfit for drinking only but for other uses as well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe water sample collected from Achabal district Anantnag are not fit for human consumption and other uses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d read the comments of the report. As per the classification of the water samples based on MPN (Most Probable Number) coliform count test, water with MPN count zero is considered as excellent, water with MPN count 1 to 3 per 100 ml is considered as satisfactory, water with MPN count 4 to 10 is considered as suspicious and water with more than 10 MPN count is considered as unsatisfactory. However the MPN count in the samples of both pond and the tap water has been found 180. The report also suggests the high level contamination in the water sample taken from Kanelwon Bijbehara in which the MPN count has been found 92. Health experts have expressed shock to see the contamination level in the water as suggested by the report. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was really shocked to see the report. Only the water with MPL count more than 10 is considered unsatisfactory and unsafe for drinking but here the count is 180. This is equivalent to supplying poison in the form of water. There can be no irony than this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a health expert posted in Anantnag. South Kashmir civil society, has demanded that the water samples be collected from all water supply schemes and be tested. \"We have come across the report. It was no less than a shock for us. So appeal the district administration to get the water samples from all the sources water is supplied to the people tested. Going by this report it gets clear that people are being supplied poison,\" said spokesman of south Kashmir, Rao Farman.

Around 2 to 3 new dengue cases are reported at divisional and district hospital every day. However, the health department denies the report of any confirmed dengue case in the district. \"None of the reported cases of dengue have been conformed as of yet. All the cases that have been reported so far are suspected,\" said the malaria   officer, Dr MA Khan The figure of suspected dengue cases is considerably high as the dengue wards in private as well as other government hospitals are full. Looking at the rise in demand of for platelets at blood banks of the city the situation can be termed as serious. The demands for blood platelets have also shot up in the region. The health department is also not documenting the reason of rise in the demand for platelets if it is not because of dengue. According to officials of Indian Medical Association   (IMA), Varanasi, the demands for the platelets have shot up to 200 to 250 units per day. In last one month, a minimum of 6,000 units of blood platelets were given to patients from IMA. According to Dr RK Singh, in charge, blood bank, SSPG Divisional Hospital, the blood bank of the hospital is receiving demand of around 20 units of platelets every day. He further informed that around 17 to 18 blood donations in exchange of blood platelets are being made every day, while the demand for other blood components is still the same. This is resulting in increasing the stock of other blood components by 60 to 65 units every week and patients in need of blood plasma and WBC/RBC are getting their share without any difficulty. The Elisa   (BHU) among all government hospitals. The pathologies of other government hospitals in the city do not have this facility which further troubles patients. As a result, patients have to go to private pathologies for the Elisa test. A huge rush of patients can be seen at private pathologies for Elisa test. When TOI contacted Microbiology department of SSL, BHU it came to light that out of 10 patients undergoing Elisa test (confirmatory test for dengue), 9 cases result positive. According to IMS, BHU director Rana Gopal Singh, every week nearly 5-6 dengue patients are being admitted in the hospital.

Municipal health officials in Ahmedabad have already started sending feelers to private hospitals regarding the issue.\n\nThese kits, most of which are imported, are not adequately evaluated by any Indian scientific agency, while some are not even approved by the country where they are manufactured, leading to false positive dengue test reports, claim AMC officials.\n\nEarly clinical features of dengue often resemble chikungunya viral infection and even malaria. Post-monsoon, cases of all these infections are reported together. Most of these commercial rapid test kits are available in the market in the form of MAC-ELISA, dipstick ELISA and immunochromatographic tests for detection of antigen and antibody detection. These kits differ from each other when it comes to the format of tests. The window period for detecting dengue viral infection is anywhere from the time when one gets fever to about 10 days. There is also the possibility of the masking effect of IgG antibody levels, especially in secondary immune response in the indirect ELISA test format."}

There might be no scientific answer for this, but people suffering from mosquito-borne diseases are consuming juices extracted from papaya leaves as a household remedy. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's ( AMC  ) health department has detected 422 cases of dengue and 63 cases of chikungunya in September alone, as compared to 467 dengue and 56 chikungunya cases   last month. Nalin Pandya, a city-based horticulturist, says, \"Papaya leaves regulate and increase the dipping platelet count in the blood. In cases of dengue where the platelet count drops sharply, papaya leaves have proved to be an effective treatment.\" Pandya added that papaya leaves also help in regulating healthy blood circulation in the body. He has witnessed an increase in the demand of papaya leaves in the past three weeks, with the sale of 3 to 4 papaya plants per day. A papaya plant is sold for Rs 15 to Rs 25, depending on the size in different nurseries across the city. Anilbhai Thakur, who runs a nursery in Navrangpura, says, \"Because of increase in demand for papaya leaves, there is no stock left at our nursery. We have booked more plants from Baroda.\" Apart from nurseries, people are tracing papaya plants grown in nearby localities and gardens. Jayshree Shah, who recently recovered from chikungunya, says, \"Along with medicines prescribed by my doctor, I consumed the juice of papaya leaves for nearly two weeks, which proved to be a miraculous remedy.\" Because of its proven benefits, doctors are also recommending the use of papaya leaves. Dr Ronak Shah, MD-Medicine, says, \"It has been observed that juice from papaya leaves improves the platelet blood counts in the body. Also, in some cases of chikungunya where the platelet count is in question, papaya leaves help to better the health condition.\" According to Dr Pravin Hirpara, a noted Ayurvedic consultant, juices from papaya plant has proved to be a better dengue cure than chikungunya. He says, \"Juice from a middle-sized papaya leaf should be consumed every day to have a healthy platelet blood count in human body.\" Times view   Modern medicine has never been more accommodative than it is today when it comes to alternative therapies and supplemental treatments. For instance, after scientific investigations suggested that cinnamon may be good for diabetics, the old \"gharelu nuska\" secured a firmer place in the overall diet plan prescribed by experts. But cinnamon did not replace blood-sugar-lowering drugs. So people who are turning to papaya to deal with chikungunya must remember that it could be fatal to rely on home remedies without consulting a doctor. And doctors must explain to their patients how scientifically tested cures improve the chances of positive outcomes in treatment.

XXXXXX Ahmedabad >   Cloudy and rainy weather has got many Amdavadis reporting sick at their workplace or school or college.   According to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation&rsquo;s (AMC) weekly health report, 757 cases of diarrhoea and vomiting have been reported this year (19 days of August) compared to the 818 cases reported in the 31 days of August 2012.   Again, 1,055 cases of Plasmodium Vivax or malaria (5,379 for 31 days of August 2012) and 216 cases of Plasmodium Falciparum or the more dangerous malignant malaria (756 for 31 days of August 2012) have been reported in 19 days of August 2013.   As for dengue, 110 cases have been reported this year compared to the 234 for 31 days of August 2012. But these, claimed physicians, could be easily prevented without going overboard with the preventive measures.   Regarding the preventions one could take, general physician Suresh Shah suggested: &ldquo;Avoid strolling in the garden before sunrise and after sunset, sprinkle insecticide and pesticides on stagnant water if you are unable to completely get rid off the water body. And lastly, make use of mosquito repellents, be it applying cream or plugging in an electric device. Also, definitely avoid eating out.&rdquo;   Besides sharing similar views, Ahmedabad Medical Association&rsquo;s library secretary Mehul Shelat advised that one must drink lots of water. &ldquo;Also consume fruits rich in vitamins,&rdquo; he said.   Shelat further stated that when eating out in such weather, one must ensure that food prepared was fresh and possibly hot. And while spending time with friends and family over bonfire in a garden, Shelat advised wearing full-length clothes, thereby giving no room for mosquitoes to attack.   Regarding the symptoms, Shah said for dengue, platelets start going below the normal count of 1-1.5 lakh and the patient suffers high temperature. &ldquo;In case of malaria, too, patients suffer high temperature coupled with shivering at regular intervals. However, everyday visit to the doctor along with blood tests can help suppress its long effect on the patient&rsquo;s health,&rdquo; he said.   Shelat added that for dengue, patients should watch out for eye and stomach aches. &ldquo;Sometimes, even rashes and bleeding could happen. In such cases, doctor&rsquo;s guidance should be taken immediately,&rdquo; he said.   As for chikungunya cases, which both doctors claimed, were on the rise, visible symptoms included severe joint pain, high temperature and severe headache.   What about AMC&rsquo;s preventive measures? Health officer SP Kulkarni said insecticide was being sprayed on stagnant water and in case of larger areas with garbage or water, tankers were being used to spray the same.

About a dozen children fell ill and were taken to hospital after drinking suspected contaminated water at their school in eastern India, a hospital official said. AFP   PATNA, India (AFP) &#8211; &nbsp;  About a dozen children in eastern India fell ill and were taken to hospital on Thursday after drinking suspected contaminated water at their school, a hospital official said.  The children became sick after drinking water from a hand pump in the dirt-poor state of Bihar, in the same district where 23 children died last month after eating a poisoned lunch provided by their school.  They were in a stable condition at a hospital in the state capital Patna, after drinking the water at their village school in Saran district, hospital superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar told AFP.  \"They were taken to hospital when their condition deteriorated after drinking the water from the pump,\" he said.  The ages of the children are unknown but they were from a middle school which students usually aged 11-14 attend.  Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said he ordered the state's police chief to investigate, as \"reports of poison being mixed into hand pumps at schools are coming from different places\".  The incident comes after the 23 children, aged four to 12, died after eating their free lunch of lentils, potatoes and rice cooked at their primary school in a village in Saran district on July 16.  Oil used to cook the food contained a pesticide that was five times the strength sold in the marketplace, a forensic report after the tragedy found.  Police arrested the head teacher of that school for questioning over the tragedy, which sparked angry protests from anguished parents and residents.  Free lunches are offered to some 120 million schoolchildren throughout India in what is the world's largest school feeding programme. Bihar is one of the country's poorest and most densely-populated states.  Educators see the midday meal scheme as a way to increase school attendance, in a country where almost half of all young children are undernourished. But children often suffer from food poisoning due to poor hygiene in kitchens and occasionally sub-standard food.  The July 16 tragedy raised concerns about the midday meal programme, with reports of children too scared to eat their food. For many children in Bihar, the free lunch is their only meal of the day.  Thousands of teachers in Bihar also refused to serve the lunches, saying they were being blamed for the poor quality of the food.

XXXXXX  &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Jaipur   4 students fall ill after drinking contaminated water from school tap  The writer has posted comments on this article   where their condition is said to be stable. The school administration has initiated an inquiry into the incident. According to sources, four students- Ashok, Panchang Sharma, Deepenshu and Manohar- went out of the class to drink water from the school tap in the morning. \"Five taps are linked to the main water tank of the school. They had water from one of the taps,\" said sources. After drinking water, they returned to their classroom and soon complained of stomach ache and vomitting. \"The class teacher sent the boys to the local school dispensary from where they got some medicine. Sometime later, they again complained of severe pain in the stomach,\" sources said. As their condition worsened, the school rushed them to JLN hospital. In a preliminary inquiry, it was found that the water had a phenyl-like smell. School principal R C Sharma visited the children at the hospital but refused to comment on the issue. Sources said that it could be possible that a bottle of phenyl went into the main water tank which led to the contamination. School administration is looking at various aspects on why only four students fell ill when others too had consumed water from the same tap during lunch break.

XXXXXX  Wednesday, November 20, 2013 01:29 PM  Dengue becomes year-long phenomenon as cases see two-fold rise   20th November 2013 11:47 AM  Dengue, which has kept state Health Department officials on their toes, has shown an almost 100 per cent increase this year compared to 2012.  According to data available with the joint director of National Vector Borne Disease Control programme, up to November 19 this year, 6,053 cases were reported, compared to 3,615 for the same period last year.  However, in 2012, 21 people died due to dengue, including four in Bangalore. This year, the number has came down to 12 and no dengue deaths have been reported in Bangalore.  Experts said scarcity of water during summer and incessant rains during monsoon this year led to the rise in the number of dengue cases.  Dr D Narayanappa, HOD of department of paediatrics of JSS Hospital, Mysore, said there has been a two-fold increase in dengue cases this year.  \u201cDengue has now become a year-long phenomenon. On Monday, a four-month-old baby with dengue symptoms was admitted to the hospital,\u201d he said. There are many cases coming in from Mandya and surroundings areas as well, he added.  Deputy director of Vector-borne Disease Department Dr Jagadish told Express that to bring down the dengue incidence, the department would initiate its screening and house-to-house survey and Information Education and Communication (IEC) programme from January 2014.  Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) nodal director Dr Manoranjan Hegde said Bangalore faced water supply problems last year and people used to stock water for weeks and this resulted in the spreading of dengue larvae.  BBMP doctors and medical college students have undertaken a campaign to spread the message of cleanliness and see to it\u00a0 that water pots are always covered to contain the breeding of mosquito.  Hegde also said the BBMP is hoping to bring up a micro-plan from 2014 and expand its awareness programmes.  50 thousand strong force to take on China &#039;Chandy concealed facts in solar scam&#039; Modi laughs at Rahul&#039;s rallies Dual power in a single kitchen Gwalior: Palaces, fort and a lot of history More from this section &#039;Eternal vigilance is the only mantra&#039; BBP struggles with adoption, Mysore zoo finds many takers &#039;While prices have gone up, our margins have stood still&#039; India, West Indies teams arrive for first ODI  Your e-mail address   All comments will be reactively moderated   Disclaimer: The views expressed in comments published on are those of the comment writers alone.

Although several dengue deaths were reported in the State this year, health officials claimed that only 12 people have succumbed to the disease since January. In Bangalore, while more than 20 deaths have been reported, health officials deny there was any dengue death. The disease had peaked in July when more than 400 cases were reported from Bangalore alone. With the spurt in dengue cases, the demand for platelets went up considerably in July. Finding it difficult to meet the increasing demand, blood banks were asking people to look for donors or offer blood replacement to the banks in exchange for the platelets. As most government blood banks do not have component separation facilities, poor patients visiting government hospitals were forced to buy platelets at higher prices from private blood banks. State Joint Director (vector-borne disease control) M. Sulochana told The Hindu that the number of cases had come down drastically since August. Of the total 5,957 positive cases, including 1,047 from Bangalore, since January, nearly 2,000 (including 400 from Bangalore) were reported in July, she said. During the same period in 2012, 3,175 positive cases, including 868 from Bangalore, had been reported. Asserting that the disease was under control this year compared to 2012, Dr. Sulochana said 21 deaths were reported last year. Four of these were from Bangalore, she said. K. Sangamitra, Nodal Officer for National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme in Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), said the city had not recorded \u201cany dengue death\u201d since January. \u201cWe have got reports about two suspected dengue deaths from M.S. Ramaiah Hospital and Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health last week and our dengue audit team would soon confirm whether these deaths were because of dengue or not,\u201d she said. While unofficial numbers have not been collated, many more people have been infected by the dengue virus and doctors in both government and private hospitals confirmed this to The Hindu . Health officials, who claimed that prevention and control measures had been initiated, have been insisting that only samples that test positive at the 21 sentinel laboratories identified under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme could be considered as positive.

With dengue cases reported in areas located a few metres away from the district Wenlock Hospital in the last few days, there have been questions over the effective control of the disease. \n\nKaprigudda in Attavar ward witnessed sudden outbreak of the disease around four months ago. Every house in the neighbourhood had one or the other patient with dengue. Despite the health department\u2019s claims that the disease is under control in the area, dengue cases have now spread to the nearby areas like the lane behind Hotel Moti Mahal where the patients with dengue were admitted to a private hospital last week. \n\nTotal cases\n\nAccording to the statistics available with the MCC\u2019s health department, as many as 31 dengue positive cases have been reported this month as on October 24. The total number of cases reported in September is 47, August - 35, July - 37 and June - 23. A total of 191 dengue cases have been reported in the MCC limits in 2013, out of the total 287 cases reported in Dakshina Kannada district. Out of 191 cases, 41 cases were confirmed in Elisa test, while the remaining were NSI positive cases.\n\nMangalore Nagara Parisrasakthara Okkuta President Suresh Shetty is of the opinion that the health department should have taken precautionary measures before the outbreak of the disease rather than indulging in delayed control mechanism. \u201cIt is for the first time that Mangalore city has witnessed the outbreak of dengue and perhaps, it should be a lesson for the health department to develop mechanisms to prevent the outbreak in the coming years,\u201d he told Deccan Herald. \n\nHowever, he regretted that nothing much has been done to prevent the outbreak of disease, despite the health minister hailing from the city.\n\nMCC Health Officer Manjayya Shetty blamed the lethargic attitude of citizens in preventing the onslaught of disease. \u201cWe have deployed 42 multi-purpose workers who are not only creating awareness, but also destroying mosquito breeding areas at houses and construction sites, distributing guppy fish and fogging to prevent dengue and malaria in the city. Many a time, our workers do not receive cooperation from the people,\u201d he said.\n\nDistrict Health Officer Dr Shivakumar said that the department\u2019s surveillance unit is working throughout, towards source reduction. The department has distributed over 300 mosquito nets smeared with chemicals to construction workers and other underprivileged class in the city limits who are more prone to mosquito bites."}

Usually, with a rise in life expectancy biological morbidity must decline. This phenomenon has led the health optimists in developed countries to predict \u201ccompression of morbidity\u201d in which life expectancy will reach its natural upper limit and most reported diseases will be confined to the very last year or years to life,\u201d he said.  \u00a0According to him, Kerala\u2019s health paradox was due to diseases linked to under development and poverty. \u201cPoor quality of environment, effects of population ageing, lifestyle diseases, water contamination, seasonality etc are all contributing factors to high morbidity. Due to lifestyle changes brought about by technology and urbanisation, Keralites are now physically less active than their forefathers. Abandoning of public health strategies that helped the state to control communicable diseases in the past, is resulting in the re-emergence of these diseases. Poor disease monitoring systems and a defunct Pollution Control Board are adding to the helplessness of Kerala\u2019s health system,\u201d he said.

Two patients are from city areas - Sector 32 and Raman Enclave - and one each from Bathinda, Fatehgarh Sahib, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur and Ferozepur. Two are from Jalandhar, while two dengue patients belong to Jammu and Kashmir.   According to the health department, a total of 51 cases of dengue were reported from city hospitals this year. Of them, 19 patients belong to Ludhiana district.  Meanwhile, due to absence of timely fogging, larvae of Aedes mosquitoes have spread in various parts of the district.  The Ludhiana health department has found larvae of Aedes mosquitoes, which carry dengue parasite to the human body, at more than 100 places in the city so far.  Even some major city hospitals have failed to control breeding of the mosquitoes on their premises.  According to the health department, the teams also found the larvae on the premises of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Pahwa Hospital, Gurdev Hospital, Mohan Dai Oswal Hospital, BL Kapoor Hospital and Bhagwan Ram Charitable Hospital.  District epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said, \"We have found larvae of mosquitoes at more than 100 places in the city this year and also in coolers and containers kept on the premises of six city hospitals. We had given warnings to people to avoid stagnation of water.  He added that the larvae were found in Aman Nagar, Islam Ganj, Guru Nanak Pura, BRS Nagar, Railway Colony, Jammu Colony, Field Ganj, Saroop Nagar, Salem Tabri, New Shimla Puri, Shiv Puri, Prem Nagar, Islam Ganj, Sham Nagar, Chowwani Mohalla, Makkar Colony, Bihari Colony, Sherpur Chowk, Tyre Market opposite railway station, Transport Nagar, Dhandari, Issa Nagri and other areas.  \"Our teams found maximum larvae at 30 different places in Field Ganj. We are creating awareness by distributing pamphlets and by addressing the public on prevention of dengue,\" Dr Verma added.  \"We also conduct insecticide spray in those areas of the city from where dengue cases are being reported. We have also found larvae and mosquitoes in those areas of city from where the dengue cases were reported in the past few days. A special team of the health and family welfare department is also conducting a survey on dengue cases and to check larvae or adult Aedes mosquitoes in different city areas,\" he added.  Sanjeev Kumar, a resident of Rajiv Gandhi Colony, which has a slum area, said fogging was not being conducted in their area, while water was stagnant at different places.  MC additional commissioner Sumit Jarangal claimed, \"We conduct fogging at least once after 10 days in all parts under the Ludhiana municipal corporation.

Patients were admitted to the Civil Hospital, Jagraon, and Kalyani Hospital, Jagraon, while a few were also at a camp organised by the health authorities at Dharamshala village.  Contaminated water supply was the main reason for this outbreak, said district epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma. Cases of mild diarrhoea were being reported for the past two days but the condition worsened on Thursday. Teams from three dispensaries of Sidhwan Bet have organised a health camp at this village.  While water supply connections were disconnected, water was now being supplied through water tankers in the affected areas.  Sources in the water supply department said illegal water connection taken by one of the residents was the result of water contamination. The health department took four water and stool samples from that village. Report will come in three-four days.  The residents said they had complained to the authorities earlier as well, but no one came to check the water supply lines. The outbreak occurred in one Vehra colony of the village where mostly poor families reside.

However, sources with the health department claimed that the figures could be much higher. Meanwhile, with the   malaria cases on rise, doctors advised the residents precautions, asking them to prevent breeding of female Anopheles mosquitoes, the vector that carries malaria parasite to human being. Stagnant water at various places and objects are breeding ground for mosquitoes that cause dengue and malaria.  Dr Anil Verma, district epidemiologist, said the situation was still under control, but the residents should follow precautions to prevent breeding of mosquitoes carrying dengue and malaria parasites. He said the health department was also sensitising residents of various localities to prevent breeding of mosquitoes, as awareness can protect people from diseases.  Dr Navjot Singh, professor at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said the cases of malaria could increase further in the season, as stagnant water provide breeding ground to mosquitoes.  Talking about its symptoms, Dr Singh said: \u201cHigh fever, shivering, vomiting, nausea, headache, cough, rashes are common symptoms. In severe cases, bleeding is also possible and patient can become unconscious. In some cases, a person can suffer from seizures and blood sugar level can also fall.\u201d  He further said it could also affect various vital organs; hence doctor should be consulted timely. He further said medicines were available for the treatment of malaria. Dr Sandeep Puri, medical superintendent at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), said three patients of malaria were under his treatment.  Meanwhile, the residents are demanding timely fogging so that diseases could be prevented. Harjit Singh of Gurubagh Colony said the stagnant water problem was common at his locality, so that the authorities concerned should ensure proper fogging.  The doctors, meanwhile, advised the residents not to allow water to accumulate around their house and spray insecticide.

When the health team led by district health officer Dr Abnash Kumar visited Tyres market, majority of shops were closed due to Sunday. The team found stagnant water in many tyres, which were kept in open places outside shops and in vacant places.  According to health department, the larvae of aedes mosquitoes could form in the water accumulated in the tyres within the coming two to three days, if preventions were not taken. District epidemiologist Dr Anil Verma said they had given strict warning to shop owners against keeping the tyres in open.  Meanwhile, a few of shopkeepers on the spot assured the team of cleaning the tyres and storing them inside the shops.  Satinder Singh, incharge of anti-malaria wing, said larvae of aedes mosquitoes could form in 5ml water, so water should not be allowed to accumulate.  He said mosquito larvae could form even in a bottle cap if water was allowed to accumulate in it.  The team also visited Transport Nagar and Samrala Chowk, where also they found water accumulated in tyres. Manpreet Singh, inspector, anti-malaria wing, said they created awareness among residents about prevention of dengue.

The city has registered three times the number of dengue cases it registered last year.\n\n \n\n The city had registered 75 dengue cases last year and against that the number has shot up to 223 as per the VMC records on Monday. The rise is being seen in line with the overall situation regarding the disease in the state.\n\n \n\n VMC officials said the high number of cases was owing to the fact that the city witnessed a longer wet spell due to rains in October much after the monsoon got over. \"Dengue cases usually rise toward the end of the monsoon in August and September. But this year we witnessed rains even in October and this has led to the prevalence of the disease even in October and November,\" said an official. The dengue mosquito aedis aegypti is known to breed in fresh stagnated water. Such breeding places were available for a longer time to the mosquito this year.\n\n \n\n Officials said another reason for the higher number of patients this year was a stronger reporting system. The VMC had issued notices to hospitals and clinics in the city asking them to report any dengue cases without fail.\n\n \n\n VMC functionaries said that a major relief, however, was that no death due to dengue had been reported in the city. A couple of suspected dengue deaths had come to light, but tests have not yet confirmed these.\n\n \n\n Chikungunya cases trickle in\n\n \n\n Only a few chikungunya cases were reported in the city when some other parts of the state were witnessing an outbreak of the disease. The disease has raised its head in Vadodara now. Sources in the civic body said with the rise in number of dengue cases, some prevalence of chikungunya was expected. Till August this year, only two cases were reported in the city and these too were an aberration from the trend as they came to light in March. But since September, the city has registered 25 cases as per VMC records.\n\n"}

According to statistics of the reported cases of malaria available with the VMC's health department, Vadodara has recorded a total of 1,101 cases of malaria from January to August, this year \u0097 80 of which are falciparum. However, VMC health officers say that the threat of malaria cannot be eliminated completely during the phase when the virus is transmitted during monsoon. In 2012, until July, Vadodara had recorded a total of 1,061 cases of malaria, out of which 63 tested positive for falciparum. This year, in August alone, 56 cases of malaria were reported and eight cases tested positive for falciparum. Though VMC officials point out at the declining number of overall cases of malaria being reported this year as compared to last year, the increase in the number of critical malaria cases is a major concern for the authorities. Health officers of the VMC, who are overseeing the health activities in various wards, say though there is sufficient grant for fumigation and other steps to prevent malaria, a complete elimination of the virus is impractical. \"It cannot be completely eradicated as there is a period during which the mosquitoes breed and are transmitting the virus to those exposed to mosquito bites,\" officials say. Doctors at private hospitals say that many cases go unreported as the VMC only shows the number of cases that it records from government hospitals. A doctor from SSG Hospital in Vadodara says, \"The VMC seeks data from the government hospitals. However, private hospitals are not reporting all cases of detected malaria, which would certainly add up to the number.\" ... contd.

The high rate this season has been a matter of worry for the health authorities as well as local residents. In the past three months, there has been a constant inflow of patients with dengue virus in the civil hospital. Though the peak season for the spread of the disease is over, the virus is showing no signs of abating. District epidemiologist Dr Sailesh admitted that dengue cases were much higher this year. \u201cNearly 100 patients have tested positive, including those who were directly admitted to the DMCH Ludhiana or other higher health institutes,\u201d he said. Stating that very few cases were reported from rural areas, he said most of the affected patients came from slum areas of Sunder Nagar, Bhim Nagar and Aslamabad. Civil surgeon Dr Surjit Singh said the department was spreading awareness about dengue and was carrying out fogging. \u201cWe have created dedicated facilities at hospitals to treat the dengue patients at the earliest,\u201d he said. He asked people not to panic and advised them not to allow water stagnate in and around their houses. Patients and their relatives are, however, facing tough time as arranging blood is a challenging task. Sources said in many private hospitals where blood component separation facility is not available, doctors were transfusing blood of the entire body instead of platelets.

Eight seriously-ill children have been admitted to a trauma centre in Rewari, while other students are getting treatment at primary health centres in Khol and Siha villages, he said.  Similarly in Jind district, 66 school kids were taken ill after consuming the tablets in a school in Ghoghadia village, Medical Officer Jaspreet said.  He said the children were admitted to the health centre with complains of stomach-ache and vomiting, and were later released after treatment.  The medicine was given to them after the mid-day meal.  Nearly 1,000 students had fallen ill after consuming iron tablets in government schools in several districts of Haryana during the past few days.  Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, however, sought to allay fear over administering of the medicines, saying that as many as 18 lakh children are being given the medicines under the programme.  \"It is a national programme being carried out under the  prescription of doctors to combat anaemia in children, so that they remain mentally and physically fit,\" Hooda told reporters in Chandigarh.  He said there are some preventive measures which need to be taken while administering the tablets.  These pills should be administered to children only after the meals, and not be given to ailing children, Hooda said.  Officials also termed the iron dosage as necessary, pointing out that nearly 70 per cent children in the state are anaemic.  \"16 lakh children have been given iron pills in the state and only one among 2,000 has complained of nausea, vomiting or stomach-ache. These are mild side effects that last for short duration,\" said Rakesh Gupta, Director of NRHM (Haryana).  He said most of the cases reported from rural areas are psychological, hysteric or having domino effect.  The children who took the pills empty stomach with little water complained about the side effects, Gupta said.

The children suffered from nausea and complained of stomach ache after taking the tablets as part of the state&rsquo;s weekly iron folic acid supplementation programme to eradicate anaemia from Haryana. &ldquo;The students found suffering from mild side effects will be administered sub normal dose of 60 mg for four weeks to accommodate the absorption of iron,&rdquo; Rakesh Gupta, mission director, National Rural Health Mission (Haryana), said.   Most of the children, belonging to various districts including Hissar, Jind, Sonipat, Gurgaon and Faridabad, were discharged after treatment. Of nearly 16 lakh children, who were administered the tablets in schools in 21 districts, about 900 were found suffering from mild side-effects such as nausea and stomach ache, Gupta said.  Some 100 more were suffering from general side effects like severe diarrhoea and vomiting, he said. Gupta advised all those engaged in the WIFS campaign not to administer these tablets to children who are on fast or observing rozas. &ldquo;These tablets should also never be taken with milk or any other dairy product,&rdquo; he said. Gupta asked people not to panic as the campaign had been launched after extensive discussions among doctors. The programme was also approved by the World Health Organisation and the UNICEF, he said. No problem this time for Delhi students   Unlike the first day of administering iron and folic acid supplements to schoolchildren on July 17, no cases of side effects of the pills were reported from government schools in the capital till late on Wednesday evening, reports DHNS from New Delhi. Government officials responsible for the implementation of the programme said though they were expecting this kind of reaction from the pills, they are now better prepared and have reassured the parents to encourage children to continue taking the pills. &ldquo;We should have communicated to the parents and teachers about the side effects of these pills the first two-three times they are administered. We have now reassured the parents that such incidents will not happen anymore,&rdquo; said Dr N V Kamat, director of health services.

Also, 50 students reported sick from government schools of Fatehabad district. The students from government high schools of Chobara, Bhirdana and Ahlisadar villages complained of nausea, vomiting and stomachache and were rushed to general hospital at Fatehabad. Around 200 students from different schools of Sirsa also fell ill after taking the tablets. The condition of the students is reported to be stable. Meanwhile, the Sirsa health department have dismissed rumors that there was anything wrong with the supplementary tablets and said the programme will continue in school. Heavy police force was deployed at the hospital as parents of the students started protesting against the WIFS programme. Ram Krishan, an agitated father from Kagdana School   said, \"Will the government will stop giving iron pills to our children only after they die? When contacted, deputy chief medical officer (CMO) of Sirsa, Dr Viresh Bhushan, said, \"Iron and folic acid tablets are necessary for students as most of them belong to poor families. Their parents are unable to feed them with iron-rich food for their normal growth and many of them, especially girls, become anemic. However, the tablets must not be given on empty stomach, and if some are ill they should not be administered the dose.\" Dr Viresh said it was not possible for all students to show symptoms of sickness after consuming the tablets and some of them reportedly fell ill after seeing others vomiting, complaining of pain in the stomach and nausea, which suggests 'mass psychosis' among them. Meanwhile, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Sirsa, Santlal Pachar, said, \"Earlier, a 100mg tablet was given to each student. Now the dosage has been reduced to 60 mg. Orders for compliance have been given to every school of the district.\"   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

Instructions in this regard was issued by Sirsa Deputy Commissioner J Ganesan on Monday.  The instructions were issued to health department officials during a meeting of district-level malaria working committee.  The committee members are now expected to look for mosquitoes and its larvae in their respective areas.  To begin with, health department officials have been asked to get in touch with municipal corporation officials and get anti-mosquito larvae medicines sprayed across Sirsa city. There are over 20 villages in Sirsa, which have been identified as high risk zones when it came to malaria.  Till April end, the department have analysed over 37,000 blood samples for malaria, out of which, 48 patients were diagnosed with the disease.  Ganesan told The Indian Express, \"To eradicate malaria in the district, around 240 fever treatment depots (FTD) have been set up. Various Anganwadi, Asha workers and health department officials have been deployed there to collect blood samples and then send these to laboratories for analysis. We are also going to set up such FTDs in government schools across the district so that if a child falls sick, his blood samples can be obtained and then analysed. Samples of an ailing child can give better results.\"  \"I have also issued instructions that adequate steps be taken to curb breeding of mosquitoes. I have asked officials to crack the whip, if people do not listen.

With 18 new cases reported on Wednesday, the total number of dengue cases this season reached 565, the highest in the state. Dr Atul Garg from microbiology department of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College (GSVM) said that both dengue positive and suspected cases are being reported at the lab in large numbers.\n\n \n\n \"Including the 18 new cases, the dengue cases recorded only in the month of October are 269. Total number of dengue cases reported from GSVM microbiology department since August 08 are 565,\" added Dr Atul Garg. According to district health authorities, the dengue cases in this part of the year are not surprising as the Aedes Aegypti mosquito (vector of dengue) favours the transition period marking the onset of winter season. \"The activities of the dengue and malaria mosquito (also called tiger mosquito and day-biter) remain restricted in this part of the year but it is definitely not dormant. As the mosquito grows in fresh water, there is no dearth of harboring ground during the season. However, the mosquito becomes virtually inactive during the peak winter season,\" said Dr Deo Singh, district epidemiologist. The expert added that the dengue fever cases are usually not life-threatening except for the dengue haemorrhagic fever which brings alarming downfall of platelet count in the blood.\n\n"}

He added that a large number of samples for dengue confirmatory tests are still coming to various labs.\n\n \n\n \"It is rare that such a large number of dengue cases are being reported during this time, end of October, which is not very ideal for mosquito breeding,\" said Dr Garg.\n\n \n\n Talking about the reason for high number of dengue cases, GSCM experts said that no single reason could be attributed for this. It is governed by various man-made and environmental factors, including unprecedented growth in population, unplanned and rapid urbanization and inadequate waste management, they said.\n\n \n\n Increasing mobility of the population and poor infrastructure to monitor mosquito breeding are some other reasons for dengue spurt.\n\n \n\n Dengue is one of world's most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne disease caused by four serotypes. While type I and III are milder in nature causing classic dengue fever and fever without shock, respectively, dengue type II and IV are considered deadly.\n\n \n\n These cause fever, bleeding and a drop in platelet count. Researchers say severe dengue cases, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, started showing up in India since 1988.\n\n \n\n \"A reason behind the increased frequency could be the presence of many strains of the virus. It exposes people already infected to become susceptible to infection as they are not immune to all the subtypes,\" said Deo Singh, district epidemiologist.\n\n \n\n He added that construction sites are a major area of mosquito-breeding followed by government buildings and water tanks.

Considering an \"alarming rise in dengue cases\" in neighbouring states including Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, the Haryana Health department has further strengthened its operations to control spread of the water-borne disease. A total of 383 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported this year in Haryana, as compared to 87 cases in the corresponding period last year. \"Gurgaon is the worst affected district where a total of 166 cases have been detected. Also, one death due to dengue has been reported from district Sonepat. Dengue has also spread to new areas, which were not affected earlier,\" the state's Health department said. Haryana's director general of health services, Dr Narender Arora, said, \"Keeping in view the prevailing situation, a video conference on dengue was held to take stock of the situation and issue necessary instructions to field units. The director health services (malaria) also interacted with civil surgeons and other senior functionaries of dengue-prone districts to discuss the status of dengue and their preparation to control its spread.\" According to Haryana's Health department, \"alarming rise in incidence of dengue has been noted. It was informed that 1,729 cases have been reported from Delhi, 650 from Uttar Pradesh and 340 from Punjab. These might be seen as a source of infection to the nearby districts, including Gurgaon and Panchkula. Improper water management, external storage of stagnant rain water, practice of improper storage of water among people, unplanned construction activities and lifestyle changes are some of the major factors responsible for proliferation of breeding sites of mosquitoes and for the spread of dengue.\" \"It was decided to further intensify fogging operations, along with anti-larval operations and reserve wards for management of dengue patients and all drugs or medicine, equipment along with physicians and paramedical staff be made available in district, sub-district hospitals. It was also decided that availability of platelets for dengue patients should also be ensured. All facilities be made available in government hospitals so that people may prefer to take treatment from government hospitals and get rid of burden of heavy charges of private hospitals,\" Dr Arora said. ... contd.

They have enough testing kits to diagnose patients who test positive and need treatment,\" said Dr DK Srivastava, Director General of Health.  Ten beds have been kept aside in district hospitals, and health minister Ahmed Hasan has instructed all district hospitals to allocate 10 more beds.  The government had also ordered for purchase of equipment needed for platelet segregation at district hospitals.  Health officials maintain that private nursing homes and hospitals are declaring cases of viral as dengue and administering platelets to patients when it is not required.  \"Platelet counts fall in viral fever, not just in dengue,\" said Dr Srivastava, adding falling platelet count does not mean patients need to be administered platelets. \"Only when the platelet counts fall below 20,000 does a patient needs platelets,\" Srivastava said.  Of the 647 dengue cases, more than 600 have been treated successfully. Health minister said patients living below poverty line will be given free treatment in government hospitals.  While health officials maintain they are in wait and watch mode, Srivastava said the spread will be controlled after temperature comes down in winter.

XXXXXX (H7N9 watch) Study finds human spread of killer virus in China, suggest family vulnerability   (08-07 10:07)   Chinese scientists have found the strongest evidence yet that a new bird flu strain is sometimes able to spread from person to person, but they are emphasizing that the virus still does not transmit easily.  The strain known as H7N9 was first reported by Chinese authorities in March. As of the end of May, there were 132 infections and 37 deaths in China and Taiwan linked to the virus.  &#8220;People should not panic,'' epidemiologist Changjun Bao of Jiangsu province Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He was co-author of the study. &#8220;The transmissibility of this novel virus... was not so effective.''  Researchers interviewed the family and close friends of a father and daughter both killed by H7N9 in eastern China to figure out how the virus might have spread between them. Both lived in the same household, were critically ill during the investigation and could not be interviewed.  The father, 60, was in charge of buying food for the family and bought six live quails before falling sick. His daughter, 32, rarely left the residential district where they lived and did not have any known contact with birds, except for two black swans raised by the property owners.  The daughter took care of her father when he became ill, without wearing any protective equipment. She fell sick several days afterward and died one month later. The bird flu viruses isolated from the father and daughter were nearly genetically identical.  There is no definitive test to prove when a virus has spread from human to human, but scientists consider matching viruses and eliminating other ways the virus might have spread to be convincing evidence. Scientists also tested 43 contacts of the two patients; none was infected with H7N9.  &#8220;In this cluster, the virus was able to transmit from person-to-person,'' wrote Xian Qi of the Jiangsu Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who was the lead author of the study. The scientists concluded the transmission was &#8220;limited and non-sustainable.'' The paper was published online Tuesday in the journal BMJ.  &#8220;These findings suggest that potential genetic susceptibility might be one of the determinants and that avian influenza viruses... are more easily transmitted between individuals with genetic connection,'' said the paper.  &#8220;It is also notable that the transmission occurred between blood relatives,'' said Dr.  Peter Horby, a bird flu expert at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Hanoi, Vietnam, in a statement. Horby, who was not involved in the latest study, noted there is some evidence that genetic factors may make some people more susceptible to bird flu.  In an accompanying commentary in the BMJ, experts said similar patterns had been noted with other types of bird flu, including H5N1, another feared bird flu strain that first emerged in 1996 and has since killed millions of chickens. It has sickened more than 600 people and caused 377 deaths, mostly in Asia.  &#8220;To observe some transmission of H7N9 from human-to-human...does not necessarily indicate the virus is on course'' to spark a pandemic, wrote James Rudge of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is based at Mahidol University in Thailand, and Richard Coker of the National University of Singapore.  Still, Rudge and Coker noted several worrying features about H7N9, such as its ability go undetected in birds before sickening humans. They also warned officials to be on guard for a possible return of H7N9 in the winter; flu viruses typically spread more easily in cold weather.  &#8220;The threat posed by H7N9 has by no means passed,'' they said.

Six samples were sent to state-level  ... XXXXXX  &raquo; Punjab   &raquo; Jalandhar   Diarrhoea outbreak: 23 water samples fail test   First Published: 20:21 IST(9/9/2013) | Last Updated: 20:25 IST(9/9/2013)   A   As many as 23 water samples collected by the health department from Guru Diwan Nagar, Tara Chand colony and other cholera-affected areas of Garha locality last week have been declared unfit for human consumption.   Six samples were sent to state-level water testing laboratory in Chandigarh and other samples were tested at the district-level integrated disease surveillance project's lab.  It is said that the drinking water supply got mixed with sewage water, which contaminated it.  Multiple faults in illegal water supply connections led to the outbreak of the disease in the area, which has already claimed three lives and around 500 have fallen prey to diarrhoea so far.  On the other hand, politicians are leaving no stone unturned to show their sympathy with residents and are seen merely doing the lip-service by paying regular visits to the disease-hit areas.  On Monday, Jalandhar MP Mohinder Singh Kaypee paid a visit to the area for the first time and took a round of the affected areas.  The MP's visit to the area was not included in the schedule and he was in city to attend a function at Urban Estate Phase His visit to Garha health dispensary was, however, only for 10 minutes and he did not even bother to visit the families of those affected.  The MP, however, expressed anger over the condition of the dispensary and asked officials concerned to repair the building. He however, failed to announce any financial aid from his discretionary quota.  Speaking to HT, Sunita, a resident of the area said: \u201cThese politicians come for their own sake and are least bothered about residents' sufferings.\u201d She said the MC has failed to provide water tankers to the residents of Faggu Mohalla following which they were forced to drink contaminated water.  Another resident, Karan, said that he was suffering from diarrhoea and was on leave for the past three days.  District's epidemiologist Dr Satish Sood confirmed that all 23 water samples taken by the health department were tested unfit for human consumption.  67 new diarrhoea cases detected  On Monday, the health staff examined around 112 patients, of which 67 were found suffering from diarrhoea, apparently due to consumption of contaminated water. One of them was referred to the civil hospital.  14-year-old test positive for dengue  A 14-year-old boy, Rakshat Jain, of Sodal road was tested positive for dengue. A team of health department surveyed the locality and carried out fogging. So far, four persons have been tested positive for dengue.  Mayor 'disturbed' with continuous criticism  The continuous criticism being faced by the MC for being responsible for the outbreak of diarrhoea has apparently 'disturbed' the Mayor.  On Sunday, when local bodies minister was conducting a meeting at the health dispensary with Mayor Sunil Jyoti and civil surgeon among others, the Mayor told the civil surgeon that both, the MC as well as the health department should issue a joint statement to the media saying that it were the people, who were responsible for the disease outbreak and not the corporation.

The hospital treated two malaria cases in July.\n\n \n\n The diseases data was last compiled on August 5 for the civic records.\n\n \n\n Authorities at the premier engineering institute said they were taking extreme care to prevent the occurrence of dengue and other diseases on campus.\n\n \n\n The BMC also distributed information leaflets to create awareness on dengue in the IIT hostels in July.\n\n \n\n The public health office on the campus also issued a general advisory stating that there should not be any open accumulation of fresh water anywhere on the campus, said sources.\n\n \n\n For the first time on the campus, the public health officer also started maintaining a register with names of people who had develop fever, claimed a doctor from the IIT-B hospital.\n\n \n\n One of the hostel students who contracted the disease claimed that their hostels were generally mosquito-free, but he might have contracted it due to the waterlogging on the campus.\n\n \n\n He claimed that the maintenance personnel had been cleaning the campus frequently after the reported cases, especially the area where there were patients.\n\n \n\n \"Dengue can be confirmed only after the disease is over,\" Dr Nisha Shah, chief medical officer at the IIT-B hospital, said. \"The tests can be positive even for a patient suffering from typhoid, but it can still be determined through particular marks or rashes. Two years ago, we did have two confirmed cases. However, this year there were no confirmed cases.\"\n\n \n\n IIT-B dean of student affairs UA Yajnik said that institute had not issued any campus-wide advisory as the disease itself was locality specific.\n\n"}

And now there is another shocker to shake children out of their fairy tale stories.  About 50 children were taken ill on Friday after drinking water from a hand-pump at a school in Bihar's Sitamarhi district, officials said. This incident took place at the government middle school in Runnisaidpur of Sitamarhi, a district police officer said.   The affected children were first admitted to a primary health centre (PHC) in Runnisaidpur. But later, over a dozen became critically ill and were shifted to the district hospital for treatment.  The children complained of stomachache and started vomiting after drinking the water.  \"It appears to be the handiwork of some anti-social elements as the hand-pump might have been poisoned,\" education department officials said.  After the news spread, hundreds of villagers thronged the PHC where the children had been admitted.  Expressing concern over the incidents, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, \"I am really worried as after the contaminated mid-day meal tragedy, now reports of poison in hand-pumps at schools are coming in from various places.\"  The chief minister added that state Director General of Police Abhayanand had been directed to initiate a probe into the incidents.  As many as 23 children lost their lives July 16 after consuming contaminated mid-day meal at the government primary school in Dahrmasati Gandawan village at Mashrakh block of Saran district, 60 km from Patna.  The mid-day meal scheme is running in 72,000 schools across the state with 1.60 crore students availing hot, freshly cooked meals.  But as far as the children are concerned, they are living with nightmares of falling sick after having food and water now!

Complaining of severe stomachache, 25 of them were taken to the trauma  centre of the civil hospital here.   Two ambulances were called to take the girls to hospital as many of them could not bear the pain and wept bitterly. Parents of the girls also reached the school and protested against the administration continuing with the weekly iron and folic acid supplementation ( WIFS  ) programme, though students in many districts of Haryana had fallen ill after taking the pills. Some students alleged that teachers forced them to take the tablets when they refused to do so. Sources in the education department said there were instructions to teachers to give only half-tablet to each student, but at Jhandewala and Jagadhri schools, full dose was administered to the students. Yamunanagar district education officer (DEO) Jagjit Kaur, who reached the school, said, \"We are looking into the whole matter. I have asked concerned officials to get a copy of the instructions, which specified only half-pills to be given to the students.\"   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

Data of 2012 stated that out of the test on 95,937 people, only 16 were detected with malaria. Rao said that the initiative taken by RMC in fighting malaria has been a success. \"Health department has been continuously spraying anti-larva and temiphos at least twice, in two zones, of all the wards on daily basis. Besides, two fogging machines other than hand fogging machines are also being used in many areas of the city. This has reduced breeding of mosquitoes to a great extent,\" added Rao. RMC officials   said that health department in collaboration with district malaria department has been conducting awareness and prevention prgrammes on several mosquito related diseases including malaria, chikungunia, dengu, filaria and others. Suggesting precautions for the disease, Rao said, \"We suggest people to use mosquito net while sleeping and keep the doors and windows closed in the evening. In stead of using mosquito coils, burning the leaves of neem with some oil would keep them away. If at all a person has been diagnosed with malaria, they should complete the course of medicines prescribed by the doctor.\" The government had earlier announced free bed nets for the residents to give them a protective cover from the disease.

The figure includes cases in the Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar and SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack where the people of Angul had gone for the dengue test,\u201d said District Malaria Officer Dr Trilochan Pradhan.  He said Talcher, where maximum cases were reported in 2011, recorded less number of dengue patients in the season. Banarpal block in the district has the maximum of about 60 cases this year till the date. Mostly workers\u00a0 working in industries like Bhusan and JSPL are the victims, he added.

The local alleged that even though the disease has assumed alarming proportion and is spreading to new areas in the district, no step has been taken by the local administration to combat the threat.  There are areas under the municipality and villages that are full of bushes and chocked drains but no drive has been undertaken to clean those or control mosquito breeding.

No cases of dengue have been reported.  Dr Mukhmohit Singh, an epidemiologist said, \"So far, not a single case of dengue has been reported. Also, this year the number of malaria cases are lesser in comparison to last year. In 2012, by July about 75 cases of malaria had been reported.\" The NVDBP has been organising camps to educate people about the disease, especially in slum areas.  Dr Singh added that though awareness lectures about the disease were given every week and anti-larval teams had organised the Early case Detection and Prompt Treatment (EDPT) programme, the accountability of people was vital in order to prevent malaria.  People have ben encouraged to keep their surroundings neat and clean, getting water-coolers cleaned once a week and not allowing water to stagnate. The NVBDP has been issuing notices to those who fail to take these precautions.  Dr Singh said, \"So far, NVBDP officials have issued about 100 notices to people causing mosquito-genic situation in or around their house or work place. They are given 15 days time within which they have to remove the water. If the situation is not rectified the defaulters are penalized and punished under section 188-IPC.

Pregnant women are less capable of coping with malarial infections, adversely affecting the unborn foetus.\"  If not treated on time malaria can be life threatening.

It shows that Karnataka has reported the second highest number of dengue positive cases in 2013 (till date).\n\nSince January 2013 till Monday, Karnataka has reported a total of 4,782 dengue positive cases with 12 deaths. This is the second highest number after Kerala, which has reported a total of 5,801 dengue positive cases with 19 dengue deaths.\n\nHowever, it is not just dengue cases that are increasing. This month the State has also witnessed a rise in the cases of fever. Dr BN Dhanyakumar, Director, Karnataka Health and Family Welfare Department observed, \u201cThis month apparently the number of fever cases are higher. As of Monday we have reported a total of 20,391 suspected dengue cases coming in with fever, of which over 10,000 cases were reported during this month alone. But the number of dengue cases is coming down slightly.\u201d\n\nThe State Health and Family Welfare Department says that they are making strong efforts  to sensitize people. They\u2019re doing this through advertisements, generating awareness about keeping their surroundings clean, conducting continuous surveillance and  information education and communication (IEC) awareness activities.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have issued guidelines to all the District Health Officers. However, it is the public who needs to be responsible and check out if there is any water collected around their house and clean it up.\u201d\n\nOf the 4,782 dengue-positive cases, 810 are from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) area alone. When contacted, BBMP\u2019s Nodal Officer for National Vector- Borne Disease Control Programme, Dr K Sangamithra said, \u201cEvery year, the end of July till September are the peak months when dengue spreads. However we from the BBMP are doing our best. Every day we are conducting house-to- house surveys.\n\nSince the first week of June we have conducted a survey of over 3 lakh houses in the city and 31,198 houses are found to have larvae breeding grounds around their house.\n\u201cWe have also set up a dengue death audit cell. As soon as the hospitals report a case of suspected dengue death, the audit members will conduct an investigation and only then will we confirm the death.\u201d\n\nStates: \nKarnataka"}

As many as 2,434 cases have been registered till July end as against 3,512 cases registered last year.  District vector borne disease control officer Dr Arun Kumar told Deccan Herald that the Mangalore City Corporation and the district health and family welfare department had initiated awareness programmes to check the outbreak of the disease. Vulnerable sites   Construction sites are generally a breeding ground for mosquitoes carrying malaria parasite. As construction activities are on rise in Mangalore city, these sites are vulnerable and anopheles mosquitoes mostly breed in construction sites.   Dr Arun said that Confederation of Real Estate Developers&rsquo; Associations of India (CREDAI) &#8200;is lending its support to the administration in taking measures to check the spread of disease, by constituting teams meant for the site visits. The team visits construction sites once in 10 days to clean stagnant water on sites to destroy mosquitoes. In association with NRHM, a team comprising 42 members, have been constituted. &ldquo;We also keep a record of the infected labourers and keep a track on them on their health condition. If the labourers move to other districts, then we send a message to the respective district health office for follow up of the treatment.&rdquo; Medical colleges   Dr Arun said that the authorities have entered into a tie-up with community medical departments of medical colleges in the district, to create awareness among the general public. Malaria control centres have been identified at Jeppu, Attavar, Wenlock, Ladyhill, Kadri and Bejai. The centre conducts field surveys by visiting houses every week and submits a report to the DHO. &ldquo;We have been successful in controlling malaria to some extent. With the consistant efforts of the department and general public ,Malaria can be controlled fully in two years,&rdquo; he said.

In a written reply to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u00a0 member Kavatagimath Mallikarjun, the minister said the department had sent a draft action plan to contain the spread of dengue to all district administrations and instructed them to implement it in letter and spirit.  He also informed the House that the department had sanctioned 88 blood banks across the state to produce platelet concentrate to meet the demands of the dengue patients and details of its availability would be uploaded regularly on the department\u2019s website.  To spread awareness about dengue and take precautionary measures against it, the State government had also released about Rs172.65 lakh to all districts.  Khader informed JD(S) member M R Hulinaikar that the government had spent Rs 310.80 crore in last three years, including Rs 127.79 crore for 2012-13 and Rs 103.88 crore for 2011-12, to purchase medicine.  While the State government is bearing entire cost of the treatment for patients of suspected dengue admitted in the government hospitals, no such facility is being given to those admitted in private hospitals across the State.  \u2018104\u2019 Helpline Costs Rs16.50 Cr  The government is spending over Rs16.50 crore a year to operate health information helpline, 104, every year, Khader said in his written reply to Congress member Mahantesh Shivananda Koujalagi.  The Health Department\u2019s helpline, 104, at the Hubli IT Park had begun a month ago.  The minister stated that the helpline is being managed and operated by the Health Management and Research Institute, Hyderabad, which had employed over 296 personnel for providing the service.  Everyday about 2,300 people are contacting the helpline to get information on medical services.  There are plans to strengthen the helpline service from the present 100-seater to 300-seater, he said.

And the powers-that-be don\u2019t seem to be taking it seriously enough.  As per the Health Department statistics, the same period in 2012 saw 745 confirmed cases, while this year there have been 2,547 cases so far, including nine deaths.\u00a0  And the number of suspected cases is also in the same ratio \u2014 against 3,733 cases in 2012, the Health Department has identified 11,135 suspected cases this year.  In Bangalore city, there are 372 confirmed cases and 549 suspected cases.  Bangalore Urban District in-charge Minister Ramalinga Reddy, though, said on July 10 that the city had seen only 78 cases of dengue.  These, incidentally, are just the cases officially registered by the state government. Dengue cases in private clinics and hospitals have not even been accounted for, as there is no system of getting these details.  Health Minister U T Khader told Express, \u201cYes, there is an increase in the number of cases, but it is not alarming. Instructions have been given to all the district health officials to continue the awareness drive on dengue control. From next year, we will begin this activity in January itself as a preventive measure.\u201d  The situation, however, has been very helpful to private hospitals. Every time a patient walks in with fever and symptoms slightly resembling dengue, they are slotted as \u2018suspected dengue\u2019, said Dr Sudarshan, Scientific Officer, Vector-Borne Disease, Department of Health and Family Welfare. \u201cAfter this, they are pressurised to undergo a series of unnecessary tests which burns a big hole in their pockets,\u201d he said.  Dr Sudarshan attributed it to the lack of awareness among patients about the presence of government sentinel surveillance laboratories across the state where tests are conducted for free. He said patients can avail the testing and diagnostic facilities at the sentinel labs while undergoing treatment at private hospitals.\u00a0 \u201cSentinel labs test patients come directly from hospitals, some of whom may not have fully understood or trusted the treatment they formerly received,\u201d he said.  When asked about why only the government is authorised to provide dengue statistics, he explained\u00a0 the strip method/card test used in these hospitals has very low accuracy. \u201cThese are non-specific and non-sensitive tests with approximately 30 to 33 per cent accuracy. It is always recommended that further tests be done.\u201d  More from this section Merge government primary schools with anganwadis: Writers  Your e-mail address   All comments will be reactively moderated   Disclaimer: The views expressed in comments published on are those of the comment writers alone.

Of the 348 samples sent for testing, 233 tested positive for the fever since January. In a review meeting held on Wednesday, Health Commissioner V B Patil instructed the health department of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike to intensify dengue awareness through its various source reduction programmes, which include door-to-door visits by health workers to educate residents about the importance of keeping the surrounding clean and dry. Besides, fresh guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Health on handling dengue cases will be circulated among all government and private hospitals, Patil said.   He also instructed the Palike to direct private hospitals to share with the health department details of dengue cases available with them. The Health and Family Welfare department has also instructed the Palike to set up a laboratory to test suspected blood samples for dengue. A Palike official confirmed that a laboratory was on the anvil, but a place for the purpose had not been identified yet. He said blood samples would be put through ELISA&#8200;(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) tests and the equipment was yet to be procured. State-wide update  Of the 9,123 suspected cases and 6,164 blood samples collected, 2,062 tested positive for dengue since January. The health department has reported eight dengue deaths in the State &ndash; two each in Mysore and Chikmagalur and one each in Davangere, Shimoga, Belgaum and Haveri.

About 805 of them are confirmed to have the fever and according to official figures, two of them have died. Health and family welfare director Dr Dhanya Kumar told Express: \u201cThe number of dengue cases will come down now, as the state is\u00a0 receiving good rains. So far, two deaths have been reported due to dengue in the state. Other deaths following\u00a0 suspected dengue proved negative after we used the Mac Elisa test. Still, all the district health officers (DHO) have been asked to send a daily dengue surveillance report to the department, which I am personally monitoring.\u2019\u2019 The two deaths reported are in D Salundi village near Mysore. However, Belgaum district surgeon Dr S T Kalasad told Express that an 18-year-old girl, Archana, died due to dengue. \u00a0\u201cShe was treated for the disease in Maharashtra, and underwent treatment here also for five days,\u2019\u2019 he added.

The recent death of a woman Nagarathna from Chennapatna taluk a hospital in Bangalore has been confirmed as not due to dengue.

In 31 houses Mahadevpura and Sarvajnanagar, officials found larvae and directed the house owners to keep their premises clean. \u00a0Since January this year, 95 dengue cases have been reported in the city. BBMP Medical Health Officer, Dr Sangamitra said special teams have been formed to cover all wards. Students from nursing colleges will be part of the\u00a0 teams that will visit houses to create awareness. \u201cThe BBMP\u2019s health department staff covered 299 houses on\u00a0 Monday, 150 houses in Mahadevpura and rest in Sarvajnagar.

In the next few days, such campaigns will be carried out across the City.\u201d Following the rise in dengue cases in the City, the BBMP health department has formed eight teams headed by deputy health officers in all eight zones.

The incidence is little over 5,000 cases per year. But are these figures grounded in reality?\n\n \n\n Dakshina Kannada Parisarasktha Okkoota member Suresh Shetty alleges that the reported cases by the District Vector Borne Disease Control Office are incorrect. \"The report I have from the city corporation shows that more than 65% hospitals and laboratories do not report to the corporation health officer. In such a situation, how can you trust the figures and believe that malaria cases are down,'' he questions raising fears that malarial cases may be much more than what the health department claims.\n\n \n\n The city corporation has a list of 57 hospitals, nursing homes and laboratories. During December 2012, only 22 of the listed 57 entities reported malaria cases to the corporation authorities though malaria is a notifiable disease. It is evident from the city corporation data that only those treated in public health institutions and a few large hospitals/ nursing homes are being reported.\n\n \n\n The trend of non-reporting continues even now. A lab owner said: The district malaria cell requires smear test and we rely on QBC (also known as fluorescent technique).''\n\n \n\n District Malaria Officer Arun Kumar admits that not all hospitals, nursing homes are reporting but justifies saying that 'overall trend is more important than absolute numbers'. He also admits that almost all, barring government hospitals, use QBC. Smear test is gold standard for detection of malaria.\n\n \n\n He also says that the department uses general strategy for malaria control. \"If we get reports that there are cases at a construction site, our malaria control action activities are not limited to that site alone, but we go to all the sites. This time we are going for source reduction activity through house-to-house visit,'' he adds.\n\n \n\n Dr B Srinivas Kakkilya, physician, says: \"Earlier, malaria cases used to go to only the District Government Wenlock Hospital and KMC, so we used to get the actual numbers. Now with even general practitioners using rapid diagnostic test kits for malaria detection, it is no wonder we see decline in malaria cases, as they do not get reported. In actuality, it is much more and we need to be alert,'' he adds.\n\n \n\n What is notifiable disease?\n\n \n\n A notifiable disease is any disease that is required by law to be reported to government authorities. The collation of information allows the authorities to monitor the disease and provides early warning of possible outbreaks. Reporting notifiable diseases is both a legal and ethical requirement from all healthcare providers who treat such patients.\n\n \n\n"}

says Dr S K Ghosh, Scientist, National Institute of Malaria Research. In 2010, 44,319 malaria cases were reported. Of them, 7,936 tested positive for Plasmodium palcifurum (PF) category. The same year, the State saw 11 malarial deaths . In contrast, 2011 had 24,237 cases, of which 2,648 were in PF category. In 2012, a total of 16,618 cases were reported, of which 1,299 tested positive for PF. &ldquo;In the cases that test positive for malaria, the PF category cases should be below 30 per cent. If this is above 30 per cent, then the State will become a high-risk area for malaria,&rdquo; said a health official. &ldquo;After the 2010 incident, there were many initiatives taken by the government to ensure that the disease does not cause such a tragedy again,&rdquo; Ghosh said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, under its National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, launched awareness programmes, monitored and brought under control breeding grounds and also conducted community education campaigns. &ldquo;We also released larvivorous fish in permanent water bodies, tanks and fountains. These fish are highly effective against malaria vectors &ndash; An. culicifacies and\u00a0 An. Stephensi,&rdquo; he added. Dengue cases on rise While malaria has been brought under control, cases of dengue have risen. Doctors and experts say, dengue needs to be dealt with at a community level. &ldquo;The vector for dengue breeds in clean water bodies, and in most cases, inside a household. We can&rsquo;t go to each house and ask them to be clean and not let water accumulate. The problem is huge in whole of South-East Asia and can be brought down only if all individuals make an effort,&rdquo; said Ghosh.

In order to control breeding of mosquitoes and prevent dengue outbreak, we urge people to keep their surroundings clean. Heads of schools should pay more attention to cleanliness of the campus by looking into every nook and cranny to prevent dengue outbreak,\u201d Dr. Subramanian said. V.

Dengue-infected persons have high fever for 7 to 10 days only because it takes time for the virus to multiply. Proper medical care should be provided to them,\u201d he said. Flower pots, ornamental plants, tree holes, artificial containers and roof gutters are the common places where the aedes mosquitoes breed, he said and urged the volunteers to advise the people to clean these places frequently. \u201cAny water stagnant for seven days can facilitate breeding of aedes mosquitoes,\u201d Dr. Naavarasu said.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Madurai   Mechanism in place to tackle dengue outbreak  The writer has posted comments on this article   RELATED   MADURAI: Although health officials strongly believe that there will not be any dengue outbreak like last year in the rural areas they are well prepared for any situation. All the primary health centres and headquarters hospital are kept ready to treat dengue cases if reported. Doctors in the government as well as private hospitals have been told by the health officials to keep hydration level of the fever patients up. There has been no case of dengue reported in the rural areas. The same time last year there were several dengue cases and deaths were reported. The early ground work unlike last year in cleaning the water resources had been done. Moreover, the possibility of dengue infection to those from the same areas during last year's outbreak is very less as the people would have developed immunity to the diseases, officials say. Talking about the precautionary measures taken by the district, Dr S Senthil Kumar said that Eliza is the only confirmatory test available to confirm dengue. It is only available at the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai and Melur Government Hospital apart from a few private hospitals. However, doctors have been told to treat all the fever cases seriously. \"In the past outbreak we learnt that dehydration is the main cause of dengue deaths. When the hydration level in the body is maintained in ideal condition the casualty   can be averted. We have asked all the doctors to provide priority in maintaining hydration level of patients with fever. The required amount of IV fluid to treat the dengue patients are in place,\" he said. \"We have carried out intensive ground work in source reduction and education the public very early this year. The awareness level among the people is also high. The possibility of dengue outbreak this year would be very minimal. However, we are not going to take it easy. Our intensive measure would continue,\" Dr Senthil Kumar added.

Yet, dengue fever has struck, with a schoolgirl becoming an early casualty and many other children under treatment for symptoms of the virus. Doctors say a key factor in the dengue outbreak this year is the scarcity of water. P. Amutha Rajeswari, president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, says the depleted groundwater level is driving residents to collect water from sundry sources and store it at home for long periods. While storing water in every conceivable object, many fail to ensure that the containers are tightly closed. \u201cDengue-causing mosquitoes don\u2019t lay eggs in ditches, drains and canals. They lay eggs only in water-filled containers kept in and around the house. It is vital to make sure that water containers are not left open,\u201d she advises. K. Sathish of Narayanapuram says the borewell in his house has dried up, and he has since been drawing water from a pipeline on the lawn at the entrance to the Collector\u2019s bungalow. \u201cI go there once a week, collect water in six to seven canisters and carry them back in my car. While this water meets the family\u2019s drinking needs, we purchase water from private tankers for bathing and washing vessels. We store water in the overhead tank and in drums. I make sure that all water containers are tightly closed. But my neighbour does not. The residents welfare associations must take a lead and sensitise their members,\u201d he adds. Ms. Rajeswari says apart from keeping water containers covered, people should regularly drain the trays attached to air coolers and refrigerators. It is important to scrub the inner walls of the containers as the dengue-causing mosquitoes lay their eggs there. \u201cThe eggs can remain intact even in empty containers for several months. They would begin hatching once water collects in the containers. Likewise, people should ensure that water does not stagnate inside empty coconut shells, unused tyres and bottles lying around the house. These items are best disposed of,\u201d she recommends. Paediatrician M. Mathivanan notes that the biggest difficulty in diagnosing dengue is the absence of any unique symptoms. \u201cPeople should visit doctors at once in the event of a slight rise in body temperature, headache, and pain in the muscles and bones. Rashes or red spots on the body could be an indication of a decrease in the blood platelet count.\u201d According to an advisory issued by the National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, doctors have been advised not to administer antibiotics and drugs such as Aspirin, Brufen or Ibubrufen to patients afflicted with dengue fever. Dr. Mathivanan stresses the importance of community participation: \u201cRather than treating the virus attack, it is wise to prevent it by containing mosquito breeding. This is possible only if society as a whole comes together and keeps the surroundings clean. It is a collective responsibility.\u201d Madurai corporation's drive against mosquitoes September 20, 2013"}

The dengue trend analysis for the period between January 1 and March 24 this year points to this glaring fact, which health officials say is a cause for concern, as normally dengue cases are reported in large numbers only during October, November and December in Tamil Nadu. Consequently, state health authorities have asked all concerned officials to prepare an action plan to tackle dengue this year. \n\n \n\n\n\n Recently, a meeting chaired by state programme officer of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr. P Kannan, was held in Coimbatore in which health officials from eight districts in the western region participated. It is learnt that officials of these districts have been alerted following the IDSP report. Deputy Director of health services in Coimbatore Dr. R Damodaran said that they have been advised to prepare a district level action plan for the prevention and control of vector borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya among others. \n\n\n\n \"In all, 299 dengue-positive cases have been recorded in Coimbatore district from January to March this year,\" he said, admitting that this is abnormally high as only 40 dengue positive cases were recorded during the corresponding period in 2012. Of these 299 cases, 136 were from rural areas and the remaining 163 from urban areas. \"Normally only urban areas record majority of the dengue cases but this year rural areas have closed the gap,\" the health official said. It may be noted that of the 152 positive cases reported in 2010, 55 were from rural and 97 from urban areas and of the 248 cases reported in 2011, 82 were from rural areas and 166 from urban areas. \n\n\n\n While the total number of dengue cases in 2012 was 472, it has already reached 299 just in the first three months. Health officials told TOI that 4634 dengue cases that have been recorded since March 24 this year also include few cases from border states including Kerala. \"Some patients from Kerala were referred to hospitals in Tamil Nadu for treatment,\" said an official."}

Health officials, senior paediatricians and general practitioners are also indicating a rise in viral fevers and the prevalence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) among children below five years this season. While the typical symptoms of viral fevers are cough, cold, fever and body pains, the HFMD is characterised by mild illness, red spots on hands and legs, sore throat and mouth ulcers. Caused by virus, HFMD, however, is self-limiting and doctors point out that children will be able to recover within a week and there are no serious complications. \u201cMost of the viral fevers among children and even adults spread through touch and frequent hand washing is mandatory. There is no specific vaccine for HFMD, but there are flu shots for specific respiratory infections such as pneumonia. HFMD will subside on its own and there is no need for parents to panic,\u201d advises in-charge Professor, Paediatrics, Gandhi Hospital, M. Vasudeva Murali. Usually, HFMD viruses spread when healthy individuals touch surfaces or objects that have been touched by infected persons. Physicians advise that because of its contagious nature, disinfecting common areas at home and cleaning up toys, pacifiers and other objects that are frequently touched by children is vital. In addition to viral fevers, the prevailing cold dry air in the atmosphere is also a reason triggering large number of cases of allergic bronchitis like wheezing and coughing among children and adults. \u201cNo need to cover children in layers of clothing. A simple cloth tied across the nose region, to prevent from inhaling the cold air, while travelling is enough. Public should avoid self medication for cough by abusing cough syrups and antibiotics,\u201d Dr. Murali pointed out. 1,200 patients The gradual rise of viral fevers has already started impacting the outpatient facilities at Gandhi and Osmania General Hospitals and Fever Hospital, which are now recording close to 1,200 patients on a single day. Most patients are having symptoms like low and high grade fever, body pains, inflammation of the throat, running nose, headache, nasal congestion, muscle and joint pains.

In September last year, there were reports of  Scrub Typhus cases  in Hyderabad also. XXXXXX Mysterious fevers proving to be a tough nut for doctors   S Guru Srikanth | ENS - HYDERABAD  25th June 2013 12:19 PM The doctors are facing a major challenge to zero in on a correct diagnosis. | EPS file photo  Monsoon has arrived, spreading infectious diseases like dengue and Japanese encephalits. But, this time, the people of the state have to be a little more cautious since there is likelihood of mystery fevers gripping the state, say experts.  Both rural and urban areas are prone to these fevers as can be deduced from the rising number of such cases in the recent past. With the symptoms of these fevers being similar to infectious diseases such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis, and the doctors are facing a major challenge to zero in on a correct diagnosis. Unfortunately, in some cases these fevers also lead to multiple organ failure.  Last month, several cases were reported in Chittoor district and other parts of Rayalaseema region. On the advice of the professors of virology of Sri Venkateswara University, tests were conducted on patients for Scrub Typhus (Mite Borne) infection and Leptospirosis. Around 80 cases of Scrub Typhus and 120 cases of Leptophyllous were suspected in the district when tests were carried out in Tirupati.  In the same month, there were reports of increasing number of cases of Scrub Typhus in Tamil Nadu and even deaths were reported in Chennai due to that viral infection. In September last year, there were reports of Scrub Typhus cases in Hyderabad also.  According to SV University virology professor DVR Sai Gopal, both Scrub Typhus and Leptospirosis are infectious diseases. He has launched an awareness campaign recently through pamphlets, radio programmes explaining about these both diseases in Tirupati and other parts of Chittoor district.  Scrub Typhus is an infectious disease caused by Rickettsia Bacteria known as Orientia tsutusgamushi.  \u2018\u2019A person can get scrub typhus if he is bitten by chigger (mite) that is infected with the bacteria. On being bitten by the mite, the bacteria are transmitted from the host to the victim,\u2019\u2019 he explained.  The disease manifests 1-3 weeks after the bite of an infected chigger. Initial symptoms include moderate fever, severe headache, shaking chills, cough, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, abdominal pain and nausea.  An eschar is formed like a cigarette burn on the part of the skin bitten by the mite. During the second and third week, if untreated, additional symptoms can include splenomegaly (enlargement of spleen), pneumonitis (lung infection), myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscled), encephalitis (infection of brain), meningitis (infection of the covering of brain), increased pulse rate, loss of consciousness and delirium.  The diagnosis of scrub typhus is based on the patient\u2019s exposure history, the clinical features and the results of serological tests like Weil-Felix text, ELISA, western blot, immunoperoxidase, immunofluorescene and PCR.  \u2018\u2019Early detection and necessary treatment can cure the patient by killing the bacteria. However it will take time become completely healthy again as the damaged tissue need to recover,\u2019\u2019 Sai Gopal said.  The mites can be present anywhere, even in the air conditioned rooms, as the moisture levels in those rooms are high where mites can thrive.\u00a0 They could be present in the carpets and among lawns outside.  \u2018\u2019Since there is no vaccine to protect against scrub typhus, it is advisable for the people to adhere to hygiene. Avoid walking bare foot, do not sit or lie on bare ground or grass, ensure the environs are clean and free of rubbish and dust,\u2019\u2019 he said.  Leptospirosis is another mystery fever caused by Leptospira, which is spread through urine of rodents. It is prevalent in rodent and rat infested areas and can spread through contaminated food or water. Even pets, farm animals can spread the disease, however person to person transmission is rare. He advises people to have their pets examined,\u00a0 avoid contact with animal urine or body fluids, not to swim, walk or consume water that may contain animal urine.

Hyderabad recorded 51 malaria cases in December 2012 against five cases in the previous year.\n\n \n\n What has been more disconcerting for authorities is that there were nine cases in the last nine days alone, officials records from the malaria wing of the Directorate Of Health states. \"Normally during November and December, the mosquito-borne diseases decline but the high numbers this year only reflect that the vector control measures such as spraying are not being taken care of adequately,\" said a general physician, who has seen several cases in the last week.\n\n \n\n Experts said mosquitoes are breeding despite the fact that there were no unusual rains this season. \"The malaria parasite disappears over the winter but in Hyderabad, the mosquito-borne disease is continuing to haunt people,\" said another specialist.\n\n \n\n The majority of cases are being reported from the Old City and Amberpet, said Dr D Shalini Devi, chief medical officer, GHMC. \"Areas along the Musi belt are contributing to the high numbers. We have conducted medical camps in these areas,\" said Dr Shalini. She said during the month of January 2012, a total 13 malaria cases were reported. However, residents claim that no action is being taken by the GHMC despite complaints. They also said that the Old City remains the most neglected area when it comes to healthcare services.\n\n \n\n \"We have not seen a single medical camp being organised in our area in Puranapul. We have been complaining to the officials about the mosquito menace in our area but no action has been taken,\" said M Mallanna, a local trader. Amberpet, Bahadurpura, Uppuguda, Vattepally, Toli Chowki, Hakimpet, Seven Tombs, Golconda, Mehdipatnam are some of the areas that continue to suffer with the mosquito menace.\n\n \n\n Last year during the monsoon season, the government organised several anti-malaria campaigns in the city, where they highlighted how mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya can be controlled by effective measures taken by residents. Officials said public participation is required to control the spurt of vector-borne diseases, but people generally do not bother clearing stagnant water or cleaning coolers regularly.\n\n \n\n Malaria is among the top five killer diseases which affects millions of Indians every year and despite several measures undertaken by the central government, the menace continues.\n\n"}

The list of affected includes Kalraj Mishra, the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Lucknow  ...          and more XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Lucknow   Dengue total jumps to 169; 45 cases in six days  The writer has posted comments on this article   LUCKNOW: As many as 45 dengue cases have come to light in the last six days. With this, the total number of dengue positive patients for the state capital stands at 169. The list of affected includes Kalraj Mishra, the Bharatiya Janata Party   MLA from Lucknow East. But, if cases from private hospitals and nursing homes were to be included, the number of persons affected would have been at least three times higher. In fact, physicians in the private sector say they were seeing at least 1-2 dengue positive persons each day. But many of these cases go unreported as they do not match the criteria of diagnosis fixed by the health officials. Public health experts stated that no matter how hard the government tries, it will not be able to contain the figures. \"Normally, dengue subsides when season changes around Diwali. Considering Diwali is in November this year, there are a good six weeks for the disease to linger,\" said an officer in the UP health directorate. If the officer is to be believed, at the present rate of around 50 dengue cases per week, Lucknow's is sure to see another 300 cases this season-highest since 2004 when dengue knocked the doors   in UP. In 2012, only 54 persons tested positive in the city. A look at the line list-data of dengue positive patients gathered from the office   of chief medical officer (CMO)-shows that a significant majority of the cases hailed from posh areas particularly Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Aliganj and Vikasnagar. Going by sheer numbers, the dengue scenario for the city fits the criteria of an 'epidemic like' situation believe health activists. Various medical and renowned dictionaries define epidemic as widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time. But health officials refute this. \"The cases are sporadic and the situation   is not epidemic. A disease is considered epidemic when it takes place in a localised area,\" argued the CMO. Dengue, termed by many experts as the world's most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease, is caused by four serotypes. While type I and III are milder in nature causing classic dengue fever   and fever without shock, respectively, dengue type II and IV are considered deadly. These cause fever, bleeding and a drop in platelet count. Meanwhile, officials at King George's Medical University informed that BJP leader Kalraj Mishra   was stable though his platelet count was lower than the normal range. In charge of the state blood bank Dr Tulika Chandra assured that the stock for platelets was satisfactory. \"Anyone in need can come to us for treatment provided they have a proper requisition slip and referral,\" she said. In another development, CMO and his team organised a health camp in Khadra, ill famous for infectious disease outbreaks. Over 750 patients of different diseases were seen during the day. PREVENTION: Officials say banking on Health department or Municipal Corporation alone would not help. \"People will have to initiate preventive measures at their end too,\" said TN Dhole, head of microbiology department, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences. \"A great scientific body of evidence suggests the first and best defense against mosquitoes is to eliminate the places where they breed,\" he added. This would mean getting rid of water stagnating in old tires, tin cans, buckets, drums, bottles, coolers or other places where mosquitoes might breed, decongesting clogged gutters, covering cisterns, cesspools, septic tanks, fire barrels, rain barrels and trash containers, leveling the low spots inside home or neighborhood to get rid of low spots where water accumulates or using household spray to kill mosquitoes, flies or other insects. People may also initiate individual steps like avoiding places and times when mosquitoes bites-just before and after sunset   and again just before dawn. Keeping doors and window screens closed, wearing long-sleeved tops and long pants, using mosquito nets and mosquito repellents are other ways to prevent infection/disease.

The number of reported cases which was 69 till the last Saturday, jumped to 121 by Thursday.\n\n \n\n As compared to the previous year, the number has already doubled. As many as 54 persons tested positive for dengue in the city last year.\n\n \n\n The trend corresponds with a health ministry prediction for the country. Answering a parliament question, minister for health and family welfare Ghulam Nabi Azad recently said that dengue had increased by 80% this season.\n\n \n\n The cases from the city however appear to be under-reported as many private nursing homes and hospitals have recorded a large number of dengue positive cases. If their data was taken into account, the city's dengue toll may reach 300.\n\n \n\n Meanwhile, health authorities accept that a nine-year-old girl Muskaan who was suffering with bilateral pneumonia (which involves both the lungs) succumbed to complications aggravated by dengue.\n\n \n\n Chief medical officer Dr SNS Yadav said there was no single reason for the increase in dengue cases. It is governed by various man-made and environmental factors including unprecedented growth in population, unplanned and rapid urbanization and inadequate waste management. He added that increasing mobility of the population and poor infrastructure to monitor mosquito breeding are the other reasons.\n\n \n\n A government hospital head claimed that preparations for clinical management of dengue cases as per guidelines provided by the ministry of health and family welfare are in place. A joint committee comprising officials from the health department and municipal corporation have formed rapid response teams to initiate mop up rounds in places where patients hail from. Data shows that posh localities like Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Vikasnagar, Kanpur Road, Aashiana, South city and Vrindavan Yojana are some of the vulnerable pockets.\n\n \n\n Dengue, termed by many experts as the world's most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease, is caused by four serotypes. While type I and III are milder in nature causing classic dengue fever and fever without shock, respectively, dengue type II and IV are considered deadly. These cause fever, bleeding and a drop in platelet count. Researchers say severe dengue cases, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, started showing up in India since 1988.\n\n"}

Kottayam is leading with 16 fever deaths compared to five in the previous year. The private andgovernment hospitals in the district have been flooded with patients, leaving many of them to roam around in other hospitals to find a bed to get admitted. Even as officials of the Health Department and local bodies have been striving hard to control the diseases, official monthly reports of the District Surveillance units (DSUs) show that there is a huge spurt in the number of virus-affected people throughout the state. According to the DSU report in Kottayam, 48 confirmed dengue cases were reported this week alone, raising the number of cases to 69 in this month and 106 cases this year, which is significantly higher than that of 34 cases in the previous year. According to medical officers, the actual number of cases could be higher as the existing pattern for confirming the disease was not up to the mark. Moreover, while the DSU report shows only two deaths this year, the officials in the Heath Department confirmed that 16 death cases were reported so far this year. \u201cThe outbreak of dengue this year commensurates the surge of chikungunya around three years ago, indicating that the disease may worsen further as an immediate control is not possible at this juncture,\u201d said Lal Antony, Pallom block nodal officer of dengue control programme. Lal said that the magnitude of the outbreak could be larger than what appears to be. \u201cWe used to conduct tests taking the samples of a few out of a larger circle, which means that if 10 cases were found positive with dengue virus, the exact number could be much higher,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Dr Bindukumari, deputy DMO in Kottayam, said there needed a serious higher level study on the significant rise in the number of dengue deaths here. \u201cThe researchers and study centres should study the situation to come up with a solution,\u201d she said. Three more cases of dengue reported Showing no respite, spread of communicable diseases has reached an explosive situation in the district as three more cases of dengue were reported on Friday. So far, a total of 441 unconfi rmed dengue cases have been reported in the district in May, of which 141 cases were confi rmed, health sources said. A total of 25 Hepatitis A cases have been reported, out of which 14 cases were confi rmed.

XXXXXX   Dengue fever cases on rise in Kottayam  The writer has posted comments on this article   KOTTAYAM: Around 50 cases of dengue fever   were reported at the Medical College Hospital here on Tuesday. Nearly 700 patients have been treated for dengue at the MCH from April 15 till Tuesday. Ward 24, where those with infectious disease are admitted and general wards have been overfilled in the last few days leading to a crisis. Dr Sajith Kumar, Head of the Infectious Diseases Department, MCH, said that dengue cases have peaked from April onwards. \"The disease-causing mosquitoes have multiplied in the summer showers we got in the last few days. Every year, either dengue or chikungunya   spreads during this time. However, this year more dengue cases have been reported,\" he said. Meanwhile, the approximate number of people affected by dengue is not available as many patients approach private hospitals for treatment. According to a doctor of a private laboratory near MCH, daily an average of 15 tests are being carried out for dengue and out of them 70 per cent tests are positive. \"There are three tests for dengue - Dengue NS1 Antigen (costs between Rs 600 and Rs 700 depending on the testing kit being used), Dengue IgM (costs Rs 450) and Dengue IgG (costs between Rs 450 and Rs 500),\" he said. The first test is carried out in patients within 8 days after first symptoms of fever are observed. Laboratory tests and treatment are free in the MCH. Dr B Ekbal, public health activist, said that a mass campaign should be organized to create awareness among people about keeping the surroundings clean and prevent the mosquitoes that spreads the disease. \"We should have the active involvement of students in the campaign,\" he said. He also said that though the state has the work force, it is not fully making use of it. \"An all-party meet should be held and a mass campaign must be organized,\" he said. Pampady panchayat, where dengue has made its presence felt, is observing this week as mosquito-eradication week. The panchayat held a meeting of its grama sabhas and devised measures to counter the spread   of the fever. \"Campaigns will be held to raise awareness on eradication of mosquitoes. Strict action will be taken against those who fail to keep their premises clean,\" said Annamma Cherian, president of Pampady grama panchayat.

When we refused, they became agitated and abused us.\" \n\n\n\n \"Our stand is clear: The clinical and lab reports of the child clearly show that she died of a haemorrhage triggered by dengue fever,\" the doctor said. \n\n\n\n But even before they could ascertain the cause of death, corporation health officials on Tuesday said Dharshini did not die of dengue. On Wednesday, the health department said they had \"scientific proof\" to prove the reports by the hospital were \"manipulated\" and its ELISA equipment was faulty. \n\n\n\n \"We don't have a problem about confirming a death caused by dengue,\" said corporation's health officer Dr P Kuganantham. \"But we checked the reports and it is clear the child did not have dengue.\" \n\n\n\n A senior public health official said the child could have died of leptospirosis or typhoid, diseases that also cause haemorrhaging. \n\n\n\n \"It is the discretion of a doctor to decide on the cause of death based on clinical evidence,\" the official said. \"Sometimes, based on a false positive test, they start treatment for dengue instead of checking for leptospirosis or typhoid.\" \n\n\n\n But doctors in the city say the corporation has been fudging the numbers of dengue deaths because the disease is a fallout of poor sanitation. \n\n\n\n Doctors at Ezhil Hospital said Dharshini's condition deteriorated rapidly and they gave her a platelet transfusion. \"We tried to save her, but her condition was already serious when she was admitted,\" a doctor said, adding the hospital immediately notified the corporation. \n\n\n\n"}

Her samples were negative. When she died, her platelet count was over three lakh, which rules out dengue,\u201d said Dr K Kolandasamy, Director Public Health and Preventive Medicine. Similar epidemiological and entomological investigations were done in the girl\u2019s locality and the spots she frequented. Officials said they found no evidence of vector or any other infected persons there. A press release issued by the Corporation of Chennai said that as per the case sheet, Rahavi had seizures and vomiting, which could have caused aspiration leading to asphyxia and death. However, in the case of the Ponmudi (8) from Podaturpet village near Pallipattu, Tiruthani, officials said they still suspect it could be a case of dengue. \u201cIn this case, the boy died of multiple organ failure and an ELIZA test was not done,\u201d a senior official from the public health department said. More Manpower In an attempt tackle diseases that come along with the monsoon, 15,000 additional workers have been recruited on a temporary basis across the State. These workers would keep a check on sanitation and help investigations in localities. According to a senior official from the Health Department, 10 domestic breeding checkers for every town panchayat and 20 Block Development Officers have been hired for every union. That apart, the Public Health and Preventive Medicine department has set up a 24-hour control room with 044-24350496 as the helpline number.

The Chennai Corporation has recorded 105 cases in the last two weeks until Saturday. Many of the affected children are from densely populated areas, said corporation officials. \n\n\n\n The findings seem similar to those of a study recently published in the Lancet medical journal, which said that children, aged five or younger, from impoverished homes are twice as likely to get malaria compared to children from affluent households. \n\n\n\n Corporation officials said most of the cases were from housing board colonies and slum tenements in Thiruvanmiyur, George Town, Sowcarpet and Royapuram. \"We had more cases from crowded parts of the city compared to the affluent parts of south and central Chennai,\" said a senior vector control officer of the civic body. \n\n\n\n \"Malaria has been known as a disease affecting the lowest strata of society,\" said Dr S Ilango, former director of public health and state president of Indian Public Health Association. \"The children could be from houses that did not have the required protective mechanisms, which come with socioeconomic development.\" \n\n\n\n Malaria is spread by the female anopheles mosquito. \"Its breeding sources are overhead tanks, river beds, wells, and water storage spots,\" said the state's chief entomologist S Sridharan. \n\n\n\n \"A thatched house would have many crevices in the roof for mosquitoes to rest. The residents are at higher risk than people living in tiled or pucca houses,\" he said. Even the affordability of a fan can make a difference. \"A person sitting under a fan is protected, because it does not allow mosquitoes to fly in that direction,\" he said. \n\n\n\n Sridharan cited the example of a fishing village in Pudupattinam to explain the fact that better housing conditions reduces malaria incidence. The village suffered a malaria outbreak in 1991 and 1992. \"Over the years, the fishermens' huts were turned to into cement houses. From 1998, there have been no cases,\" said Sridharan, adding that malaria cases in the state will come down once the state government's 1 lakh housing scheme is completed. \n\n\n\n Occupation and income also contribute to malaria prevention, said Dr Ilango. In 2001-02, the state did a study and found that a man who earned Rs 200 a day, spent 15 on mosquito repellants. \"So, only a person who earns Rs 20,000 and above can afford nets, repellant devices and ointments to protect children in the house,\" he said. \n\n\n\n Director of public health Dr R T Porkai Pandian said that though housing does not come under the health department's purview, they advise an integrated approach to fight malaria. \"We advise the state to provide more houses to people living huts. We tell them to eliminate breeding sources by providing good water and drainage systems.\""}

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Chennai   Dengue cases double over 3 years, corporation in denial mode  The writer has posted comments on this article   CHENNAI: The civic body's tall claims on mosquito control measures   seem to have fallen flat as its records show that the number of people being admitted to hospitals with dengue is increasing in the city. Data sourced by TOI from the Corporation of Chennai has revealed that the number of dengue cases   in the city has increased from 227 in 2009 to 553 in 2012. Till April this year, 15 dengue cases have been reported. With the city getting rains, many doctors said they continue to get patients with complaints of continuous fever, back and knee pain, which are symptoms of dengue. When contacted, corporation deputy commissioner (health) Dr C N Maheswaran said there has not been much of an increase in dengue cases in the city. But private hospitals said they are downplaying the cases on the instructions of corporation officials. Some said they are scared to report the cases to the civic body as the officials ask for unnecessary explanations and insist that they go through long procedures. It's also learnt that while continuing to be in denial about the spurt in dengue cases, the corporation is taking measures to control spread of the disease. Officials said they have intensified fogging operations near water bodies and in residential areas to bring down the mosquito density after the recent rains. They said the mosquito density is higher in areas like Royapuram, Manali, Tondiarpet, Teynampet, Thiruvottiyur and Kodambakkam. The hospitals in the city are also witnessing an increase in the number of patients with complaints of continuous fever. In the government-run Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, 2,873 patients were admitted with fever in the first five months of this year. The hospital dean, Dr P Ramakrishnan, said: \"We are conducting dengue tests only for those patients who have symptoms of the disease. So, we have also not reported any dengue cases this year\". Dr S Elango, former director of public health, said: \"Instead of keeping it a secret, the civic body should track the origin of the diseases. They should adopt integrated vector-control measures.\" Health experts say having proper drainage and sanitation facilities, which will prevent water stagnation, and regular fumigation will control the mosquito menace. \"The number of dengue cases will go up during the rainy season. The dengue is caused by the day-biting mosquito, Aedes agypti, which breeds in fresh water,\" said Dr S Balasubramanian of Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital.

From over a lakh cases in the 1990\u2019s, and a significant percentage of them in the urban Chennai area, today, the State has whittled down its malaria positive cases substantially, and achieved an even better record of reducing deaths from malaria. Considered an urban problem brought on by migration, rapid industrialisation, and hectic construction activity, aided by helpful monsoons in a tropical zone, malaria was the big bug bear of the State\u2019s public health system. A systematic campaign of surveillance, prevention and vector control, and aggressive screening and treatment are some of the reasons for the achievements over the years, epidemiologists point out, on the occasion of World Malaria Day on Thursday. \u201cOver the years, the number of cases has come down significantly,\u201d says S. Elango, former Director of Public Health. The reduction was not drastic, but very gradual and a result of some intensive awareness campaign, and a multi-modal approach, he adds. He points out that the most remarkable achievement has been in the Chennai Corporation area, which at some point, accounted for about 75 per cent of the cases in the State. \u201cCompared to other vector-borne diseases, Malaria is not a problem. There is no parasitic incidence among infants, which merely means there has been no case of positive malaria case among children below one year. This indicates that there is no acute, continuous transmission of malaria,\u201d Dr. Elango explains. Intensive surveillance of malarial cases has been one way of tackling the menace, explains a senior public health official at the Directorate of Public Health. \u201cWe even test cases of fever on suspicion. The percentage that tests positive is quite low, and dropping, but we do not want to take the risk of spreading infection,\u201d he says. The number of blood smears tested for malaria continues to be high in the State (over 70 lakh in 2012, for instance). The official further goes on to add that source reduction of larvae and mosquitoes are a serious business. Larvicide spraying and fogging are carried out regularly, to prevent breeding of the disease causing Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito breeds in clear water, as in wells, uncovered over head tanks, or seepage collected at dam sites, he explains. In Chennai, the \u2018Dry Day\u2019 concept, where residents are requested to clean out their overhead tanks and keep them dry for a whole day, made a big difference in keeping down the number of malarial infections, Dr. Elango says. \u201cUnless the local government authorities and members of the public co-operate, no successes are possible in vector control,\u201d according to the public health official. Government and private hospitals are aware enough to treat the fever cases, and if the patient tests positive, treat for malaria. Malaria, however, is far from ceasing to be an issue in Tamil Nadu. While the numbers have come down, there is no room for complacency. \u201cUnless the mosquito control measures are kept up, along with surveillance and testing, the State is sure to slip up. In addition, there is now the emerging issues of resistance: the vector\u2019s resistance to insecticides, and patients\u2019 resistance to one of the primary drugs, Choloroquine,\u201d Dr. Elango says."}

Sensing the big task at hand concerned health officials are at work from Thursday itself conducting health check-up of over 500 people in the affected areas in past two days. Besides, the health teams are also entrusted with the responsibility to sprinkle bleaching powder in the water-logged areas and conduct awareness campaigns in the slums to inform people about the do's and don'ts to ward off health diseases. \"Multiple health teams that were constituted ahead of the monsoon have been put on duty to act rapidly. The entire health machinery is working in close coordination for cleanliness drives in the rain-hit areas,\" said East Singhbhum district civil surgeon   Dr Jagat Bhusan Prasad. Each Rapid Action Medical Team comprises two doctors, two paramedical staff, a pharmacist and an assistant nurse and midwife (ANM). The health teams have been asked to ensure there's no shortage in the supply of medicines. The health squads are distributing dengue, malaria  , chikungunya   and brain fever medicines. \"There's no shortage of medicines for supply and teams have been asked to ensure medicines are adequately distributed to each person,\" said Dr Prasad. He also informed that large stocks   of medicines have been distributed in the past two days. Mango  , Jugsalai, Sonari, Kadma, Baghbera, Olidih in the Dhalbhum sub-division and several parts of Ghatshila, Bahragora and Potka in the Ghatshila sub-division have been affected in the torrential rains which lashed the region for three consecutive days early this week. In the neighbouring district, the health department jointly with the block office of Chandil and Seraikela is conducting health camps in affected areas. The ward members of the local zila parishad are also actively involved in the cleaning drive. \"If necessary we shall involve non-government agencies for smooth and swift accomplishment of the cleaning drive,\" said a zila parishad member.

The ministry said students, who complained of nausea and sickness, had only shown common transitory side affects of the pills. In Bokaro, the students of Class VIII - Anita Kumari, Sangeeta Kumari, Kajal Kumari and Kumari Babita - complained of uneasiness after having the tablets and started vomiting and fainted. They were rushed to the hospital. While Anita and Sangeeta recovered fast, Kajal and Babita had to be admitted in the hospital. They were released in the evening. Purendera Vikram Sahi, deputy superintendent of education (DSE), Bokaro, visited the school to assess the situation. The incident initially spread panic among other children as 30 girl students were provided the tablets on the day. The school provides iron and folic tablets one each in a week to students of classes VI to XII. Sahi said it might be possible that the girls have eaten the tablet empty stomach, this affected their health and they started feeling uneasiness. The students had been instructed several times to eat the tablets only after taking food. \"I am inquirying the matter,\" he said.

Even as BMC denies any spurt in cases, Malika Pujari and her husband Satish, who live in Divya Jyoti building near Shastri Nagar ground, said they have just been discharged from hospital following dengue. \"I was in Kapadia Hospital   for five days while my husband was in Ambani Hospital, Andheri, for seven days. Both of us had very high fever and headache,'' said Malika. Several patients from Shastri Nagar were admitted to the nearby Kapadia Hospital. Medical consultant Dr D Shrekar said, \"Our hospital has sent 25 dengue reports to BMC in the past fortnight.\" All patients came in with high fever and rashes, he said.

Anokhi's paediatrician Dr N Joshi said, \"I have another child from Jogeshwari who is admitted in the same ward for dengue.\" BMC's epidemiology cell head Dr Mangala Gomare, though, is categorical that there is nothing to worry about. \"We found only four or five patients with fever in Shastri Nagar area. Moreover, the patients tested positive on a rapid kit.\" BMC needs an antigen-based test as confirmation for dengue. Since the onset of monsoon, over 140 cases have been reported, with the incidence peaking in July with 66 cases. Mumbai has recorded close to 400 dengue cases this year and two deaths.

A total of 95 cases of dengue have been recorded in the city since the onset of monsoons this year, with 16 cases recorded last week alone.  Rubina Suleman was admitted on August 18 in the hospital after she complained of fever, vomiting and loose motions. \"She died two days later at around 5 am,\" said a doctor from the hospital.  So far, the deceased's samples have tested negative for malaria and leptospirosis, and doctors suspect only one possible option - dengue. \"Since she passed away in two days, we could not test her for dengue. Now her samples have been sent to Kasturba hospital's laboratory,\" the doctor said.  According to the doctor, a patient is tested for dengue and malaria in case he/she has fever for more than five days. Since Suleman's death occurred within two days of admission, no test could be performed.  Dr Mangala Gomare, deputy executive health officer, stated that the reports are expected in a day or two, following which the cause of death will be assessed.

XXXXXX Official record of dengue cases false, claims NGO   Mumbai Mirror Bureau   Says BMC figures vastly low while Mumbai has seen a 600% rise in dengue cases in the last five years.   A white paper presented by an NGO has claimed a 600 per cent increase in dengue cases in Mumbai over the last five years. More worrying is the fact that the number of fatalities has also gone up drastically. These figures, incidentally, are way higher than those provided by BMC. According to figures obtained through RTI by Praja Foundation, the city reported 4,867 dengue cases in 2012-13, as compared to 1,879 cases in 2011-12 and 1,404 cases in 2010-11. These startling figures, however, are vastly different from those provided by the BMC. While the civic body provides figures as per calendar year, their records state that 299 positive cases have been detected in this year so far. In 2012, 1,008 cases were reported and in 2011, merely 115 cases were reported. \"We obtained this data though RTI filed in BMC and state-run hospitals and dispensaries. The figures are all from the public sector hospitals and any data from the private sector has not even been included,\" said Nitai Mehta, managing trustee of the Praja Foundation. The NGO also revealed that the number of malaria cases, though high, was on a decline. From a whopping 78,449 malaria cases in 2010-11, the number came down to 39,828 in 2011-12 and 21,939 in 2012-13. A BMC official said the NGO will be asked to clarify these figures. \"It seems they have counted the suspected dengue cases as well,\" said the official. TB terror   In the last five years, 39,531 people have died of TB, raising concern regarding the highly infectious disease. \"Our data suggests that one in every five TB patients succumbs to the disease, which is an extremely worrisome scenario. Either these patients do not respond to the treatment or they do not complete it, due to which the mortality rate is so high,\" said NGO's project director Milind Mhaske. No questions asked   Astudy by the same NGO also revealed that 138 of 227 councillors in BMC's Public Health Committee have not asked a single question regarding health in the last one year. \"These councillors should be the ones to raise the health concerns, highlight problems and inefficacy in the field so that the issues can be solved. But the very fact that most of them do not have even a single question to ask reveals the loopholes in the system,\" said a member of the NGO.

Water-borne diseases continue to rise as complaints of contamination sweep several wards.   Gastroenteritis has also seen an overwhelming rise at more than 1,936 cases being reportesd in July. Around 35 and 37 cases of hepatitis and typhoid have also been reported, respectively. A civic official said water-borne diseases, including cholera, have been a cause of concern but there was nothing to worry. \"There is no outbreak as such. And cases are being reported from few areas such as Kalbadevi, Chembur and Byculla,\" the official said. Despite heavy rains, malaria   still appears to be under control. With 246 cases reported in the past week, the count for the month has risen to 747. The numbers are still way less than 1,485 malaria cases reported in July last year. Around 17 cases of dengue were also reported, taking the overall count to 42 for July this year. City doctors said the numbers may not be worrying as much as the severity of cases. There have been no monsoon-related deaths so far this year. One case of H1N1   was also detected last week. The viral infection has been dormant this year when compared with the rest of the state. Nearly 90 deaths have been reported in the state already, though the city has not reported any. Around 15 cases of leptospirosis have been reported in July.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Mumbai   Dengue claims kid; 8 cases of cholera in 8 days  The writer has posted comments on this article   MUMBAI: The spate of monsoon diseases appears to be worsening with a nine-year-old boy succumbing to dengue in Hinduja Hospital   and eight cases of cholera   coming up in the first eight days of July alone.   The boy, Yash Bansode, who lived in Vasai, died after a month-long hospitalization on Saturday. This is the second confirmed case of dengue death in metropolitan Mumbai; the first was that of a 42-year-old patient from Bhaktivedanta Hospital   in Mira Road. Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation   (VVMC) health officer Dr Sunil Wadkar confirmed the death and said Bansode had returned from his hometown of Sangli. Intensivist Dr Khushrav Bhajan of Hinduja Hospital said, \"The boy needed dialysis in between. He developed secondary infection, and could not fight it out.\" Meanwhile, the incidence of water-borne diseases has increased, confirmed BMC   officials. After 12 cholera cases were recorded in June, there are eight confirmed cases in the first eight days of July. Cholera is an infectious disease that causes severe diarrhea, dehydration and, in rare cases, death. Three of the eight cases this month have been recorded from B Ward or the Kalbadevi stretch. \"Eight cases in eight days does mean a spurt in cholera cases, but there is no reason to panic,\" said a senior health official. \"Cholera is something new this year as we did not have it last year. However, there is no breakout and we do not need to hit the panic button yet,\" said BMC additional municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar. Water-borne diseases are rising across the city in proportion to complaints of contaminated water flowing through municipal pipes and taps. Meanwhile, the BMC has decided to enlist the help of volunteers to spread awareness. \"We have realized that highrises are also to blame. Clearly, there is need to spread awareness that water accumulation can lead to breeding of mosquitoes,'' said Mhaiskar. BMC is roping in volunteers from NSS, TISS among others to travel to highrises. \"This programme will start from July 15.\"   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

It is a good initiative and was very useful.\"\n\nAssistant Municipal Commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar, who spearheads the initiative, told Mumbai Mirror that the summer months, when people are more likely to store water due to scarcity, see an increase in the breeding of mosquitoes.\n\n\"We are targeting large houses and residences of senior citizens, as they are very vulnerable to dengue,\" said Shankarwar. \"This ward has dozens of small and big studios and homes of film stars. So, like elsewhere, we wanted to check these places and fumigate them as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nAsked if the BMC had the authority to walk into any house in the city without notice, Shankarwar said though the BMC has to give a 24-hour notice according to the rulebook, it is impossible to follow this during such a campaign.\n\n\"People should also realise that it is for their own safety and for the larger public good,\" said Shankarwar. \"We expect citizens to co-operate with us during such public initiatives.\"\n\nHe added that the BMC is preparing notices to those occupants who refused entry to his staff.\n\n\"We will send them a proper notice and check and fumigate their houses if we find any breeding spots,\" he said.\n\nLast year saw the highest number of dengue cases reported in Mumbai, with 1,008 positive cases and five deaths.\n\nThere were 416 cases and three deaths in 2011, and 115 cases and no deaths in 2010.\n\nSources said the civic body was worried about the spread of the disease this year following an unusually high number of cases being reported in January 2013.\n\nWhile it is mistakenly presumed that dengue is a seasonal disease, the mosquitoes actually breed in fresh water and are a year-long threat. Following January's worrisome reports the corporation had stepped up its drive against the disease."}

XXXXXX  Civic body records nearly 700 malaria cases in January  Mumbaikars .   According to BMC data  , 693 people contracted malaria and 94 were treated for dengue in January. None of the vector-borne ailments claimed any lives. Physicians said it is common to treat at least a couple of malaria cases on a daily or alternate day basis during this time of the year. But dengue cases should not be rampant now. A senior physician from KEM   Hospital said the severity of dengue cases as compared to last year had come down. \"Dengue cases that we are treating now are quite common and less complicated. But we are getting more cases than we usually get at this time of the year,\" said the physician who did not wish to be named .   Last year, dengue cases had witnessed a 100% increase as compared to 2011. At the national level too, dengue cases have increased by 163% while deaths have gone up by 47%. However, BMC officials claimed dengue should not be a cause for worry. \"The graph is actually coming down now after the drive we had undertaken last year. From an average of 200 cases per month, it has come down below 100,\" said an official. Dr  KushravBhajan , chief  intensivist of  Hinduja hospital, said there has been a steady flow of malaria  caseshave been there but none too serious. \"We see malaria round the year now,\" he said. He however, added that the fluctuating temperature has causing a lot of viral and respiratory infections. \"We are also seeing a lot of cases of gastroenteritis and jaundice,\" he said.   BMC officials maintained that malaria cases had halved as compared to the numbers of January last year.   \"Overall too, there has been a 79% decrease in cases and 69% in deaths,\" said the official.

While the number of reported cases of dengue touched an all-time high in 2012, when 1008 positive cases were reported, doctors say the high January numbers are extremely strange.  &nbsp;  &ldquo;We only start getting dengue cases from April or May, when the weather starts getting warmer. This is also the time when there is a scarcity of water, and people start storing water in buckets and drums due to irregular supply,&rdquo; said Dr Pradeep Awate, head of the state&rsquo;s epidemiology cell.  Awate said efforts were being made to control the spread, but added that the onus was also on citizens, who need to be careful not to leave stagnant water uncovered.  There were five dengue deaths in 1008 cases in 2012, compared to 416 cases and three deaths in 2011. In 2010, only 115 cases of dengue were reported. These numbers put the 94 January cases in 2013 in perspective.  Senior physician Dr Pratit Samdani told Mumbai Mirror he does not remember seeing a single case of dengue in January last year. &ldquo;Just like Malaria, dengue seems to be there round the year now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, there is a drop when compared to the last three months of 2012.&rdquo;  The dengue-carrying Ades mosquito is a day biter, is shy (flies away easily), and breeds in clean, fresh water unlike malaria-carrying mosquitoes. The Ades also breeds predominantly in domestic areas, and has a life span of two weeks.  The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), a central nodal agency for the prevention and control of vector borne diseases, has already started research on the changing trend of dengue outbreaks across the country. Experts however stress that the disease is largely man-made, and the responsibility to curb it was on citizens as much as the authorities.  BMC&rsquo;s epidemiologist Dr Mangala Gomare too admitted that there were very few cases of dengue in January 2012. &ldquo;We have continued our aggressive screening for the disease.&rdquo;   KidZone   Crossword   Sudoku   \u00a9 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Till date, 87 cases have been reported in Mansa, while Bathinda has reported 88 cases. God forbid, if you happen to be down with dengue in Mansa. The machine to separate platelets from the blood is out of order here and a resident will have to visit either a private medical institute or a government hospital in Bathinda.

Mansa civil surgeon Dr JS Minhas said, \"If a case is reported in a private hospital, the doctors inform us and our health team takes blood samples for the MAC-ELIZA test to confirm the incidence of dengue. The platelet separator machine has been non-functional only for a few days and we are trying to get it in working order. We even send a team to the patients' homes if required. We have two patients of dengue at the civil hospital and nine patients are admitted at private hospitals in Mansa.\" Bathinda health officer Dr RS Randhawa said, \"One case was reported to me on Thursday. Our health teams are creating awareness among the masses. We have also involved an NGO to help us create awareness among the public. No water must be allowed to stand. Fogging is also being done and we are trying our best to take preventive steps.\" Mansa resident Jaspal Khokhar said, \"Claims of residents are on false and locals are suffering. People are not aware even as the administration claims to have launched drives. There is lack of facilities at the local hospitals to deal with the menace.\""}

The incident took place on Friday when children complained of stomach ache and vomiting after eating &ldquo;poha&rdquo; served in the midday meal in a government primary school at Bhandi village, MP. The children were rushed to district hospital for treatment. They were reported to be out of danger, officials said. Students aged between 5 and 10 said that tobacco-like smell was emanating from the food. Senior officers, including the block education officer and tahsildar, reached there to probe the matter.   The food and water samples have been sent for testing and the exact reason could be ascertained only after receiving the report, they added. In Goa, 19 students of Kamleshwar High School, an aided institution in Pernem taluk, fell ill after eating the midday meal on Saturday, officials said. While a girl was hospitalised at a primary health centre in Tuem, 40 km from Panaji, rest of the students were discharged after initial treatment, they said. The girl suffered bouts of vomiting after consuming the meal, while others felt uneasy. Though the girl is reported to be out of danger, she is still under observation. &ldquo;It is yet to be ascertained whether the incident happened due to food poisoning,&rdquo; an official said. Initial reports said that a spider was found in the meal but officials dismissed them as a rumour. An NGO, Brahmanandacharya self help group, was assigned the responsibility of serving the midday meal. The NGO has also been serving the meal to 13 primary schools and eight secondary schools, officials said. This is the second such incident in Goa during the week.

XXXXXX HC raps MP government for inept handling of dengue outbreak  The writer has posted comments on this article   JABALPUR: Criticizing the state government for its inept handling of the increasing number of dengue   cases in tribal-dominated pockets of Mandla, the Madhya Pradesh high court on Tuesday trashed the sketchy status report submitted by the health department and sought a fresh and comprehensive report about the ground situation on July 15. The division bench comprising acting chief justice K K Lahoti and justice Subhash Kekde ordered that the cost of the treatment of those afflicted with the virus would be borne by the state government, which will keep each and every case under strict surveillance. The court was responding to a PIL filed by Mandla activist Sudhir Upadhyay  . Alleging that the state's heath machinery had failed to curb the crisis that led to 10 deaths while 300 had tested positive for the deadly virus in Bakauri village, the petitioner claimed that villagers had fled their homes in panic, fearing an epidemic. Upadhyay said while the first case of dengue was reported on June 3, the expert team of four doctors from Jabalpur arrived in Bakauri only on June 23. This, the petitioner said, proved the cavalier manner in which the entire situation was managed in the impoverished belt. The petitioner's counsel said while patients were referred to Jabalpur, health officials neither kept any data nor tracked them to find out the state of medical facilities. While some patients went to the medical college there, others went to private nursing homes that had neither the expertise nor the facilities to treat dengue. The health of Ganpat Sahu, a patient who was admitted to a private hospital, apparently deteriorated because of a faulty prognosis and dilly-dallying by the authorities concerned. Sahu died last fortnight. The court demanded to know why the expert team of doctors was late in reaching Bakauri. It said the status report submitted by the government on Tuesday was too sketchy and not at all satisfactory. The report contained details of the distribution of mosquito nets and fogging operations in the affected areas, and of the awareness drive being carried out in schools.

Of the total 60 deaths, 23 were recorded in Maharashtra, followed by 19 in Kerala, 11 in Karnataka and six in Madhya Pradesh. Last year, 118 deaths were recorded in the state. \"While the number of cases this year is more, the number of deaths has declined. In the current year, 15,983 dengue cases were recorded and 60 people died,\" Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad informed the parliament on Wednesday. According to a senior health official, unprecedented population growth, unplanned and rapid urbanization, inadequate waste management, water supply mismanagement, increased distribution and densities of vector due to man-made ecological changes, gaps in public health infrastructure and poor infrastructure to monitor vector mosquito breeding are some of the reasons for the increase in the dengue cases. The Centre has sent national guidelines for clinical management of cases and has directed that a long term action plan be developed. \"In view of the upsurge and geographical spread of dengue to newer areas, a mid-term plan has been developed for prevention and control of dengue. The Centre is monitoring the dengue situation across the country on a monthly basis,\" the official said. At the state-level, the official said health officials inspected 22 lakh houses in 37,000 villages. \"Our team inspected over five million water containers and found aedes larvae in 93,000 containers. We emptied 72,000 containers while 20,000 were treated with temephos,\" he said. Further, the official said, training for dengue case management and vector control has been organized at different levels for outbreak preparedness. Rapid response teams have been constituted at the state and district levels. State total dengue cases deaths (Upto July 2013) Maharashtra 961 23 Kerala 5801 19 Karnataka 3775 11 Tamil Nadu 3079 0"}

She now has been diagnosed with dengue. Anita is among the 5801 confirmed cases of dengue from Kerala, the maximum in the country. Last year, only 1379 cases were reported till July. This year, over 3000 cases are from the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, alone. 19 people have lost their lives in the state due to dengue. Dr Faseelath Beevi, the Medical Superintendent of General Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, however, says the cases reported in August have reduced. His hospital is now witnessing below 14 dengue patients each day this month; till July there were nearly 30 per day. Two special wards have been created in the main tertiary care hospital to deal with the heavy inflow of dengue cases. \"Heavy rainfall and lack of waste disposal mechanisms are a major problem. All departments, corporations have to work in coordination with each other. It is not the health department's responsibility alone\" he says. A drive within the city shows tons of garbage disposed by the side of roads, which link major junctions in the capital city. Sadanand (name changed on request), a businessman in his late 30s, with a huge pile on garbage on his scooter asks, \"Where should we throw garbage. Can anyone tell us?\" Imported incinerators have failed to tackle the waste disposal problem. The sole waste treatment plant in Thiruvananthapuram has been closed for almost two years after allegations of mismanagement. The waste is currently being dumped at a place within the city."}

XXXXXX No info now on how dengue progresses to haemorrhage or shock syndrome   After the first dengue fever case was reported in Kerala from Kottayam in 1997, the State has had regular annual epidemics of dengue during the southwest monsoon, especially from 2001.   All four serotypes of the virus circulate in the community. The severity of the situation is heightened by the fact that the primary vector responsible for the rapid spread of dengue in Kerala is Aedes albopictus, a mosquito which breeds in huge numbers in the wild and is virtually impossible to control.   Yet, apart from launching fire-fighting responses after every outbreak, there has never been any serious attempt by the State to invest in basic dengue research or the assessment of dengue mortality, which alone will help the State prime its dengue response.   The Integrated Disease Surveillance Project&#8217;s (IDSP) reporting system is still confined to collection of numbers. The system just generates the numbers of those affected by an infectious disease and the list of fatalities. The Health Department has no information &#8212; past or current &#8212; on what proportion of the dengue-affected population in the State develops dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS).  Need of the hour   With the dengue virus growing more aggressive in virulence and magnitude with every outbreak, it is becoming clear that a war against dengue can only be fought on the basis of science; by paying more attention to the documentation and analysis of dengue epidemics.   For the first time, the Health Department has now issued a directive to all district health administrations to set up technical committees to do a detailed auditing of every dengue and fever-related fatalities, by going through case sheets and medical documents in hospitals.   &#8220;After each epidemic, the department just moves on to other activities. There are no scientific reviews or assessment on how the epidemic was managed, whether all fever deaths were due to dengue. It is important to know what percentage of the population went into DHF or DSS because it helps us anticipate the severity of the epidemic in future,&#8221; a public health expert said.   Symptoms of other infectious disease such as leptospirosis might overlap those of dengue fever. During a dengue epidemic, most fever cases would be classified as dengue but it is important to study the suspected dengue cases to ascertain if there are other concurrent infections.   &#8220;Mortality data is the fundamental requirement in any epidemiology studies. The IDSP reports show that there have been nearly 100 suspected dengue deaths this season. Dengue has been confirmed as the cause of death in only 13 cases, which alone will figure in the official stats. If not all, at least a few of these suspected deaths from both government and private hospitals should be taken up in every district for a detailed mortality analysis,&#8221; he said.   Health Department officials admit that lack of medical auditing of deaths is a serious systemic flaw. &#8220;In hospitals the cause of death might be just recorded as dengue. It is difficult for the Health Department staff to access case sheets and records from hospitals, without which we will not know how the disease progressed,&#8221; a Health official said.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  email:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Comments will be moderated 2.&nbsp; Comments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.  3.&nbsp; Please write complete sentences.

XXXXXX  Friday, June 14, 2013 10:31 AM  Dengue cases in state show a dip   Express News Service - THIRUVANANTHAPURAM  14th June 2013 09:57 AM  The lingering diseases that had surfaced with the onset of the monsoon rains in the state continues to throw out more and more disease-causing microbes. Though the disease surveillance unit describes it as \u2018rare\u2019, 37 cases of chickenpox were observed in the state, the incidence of which is more in Malappuram with 8 cases and Idukki at 7 cases. Community medicine experts say that this has nothing to do with the rains and that it is a carry-over from the summer.  \u201cOften children and youngsters can act as carriers without showing any symptoms. While chickenpox incidence is at its peak during summer, some of it might carry over into the rainy season through these carriers, who can transmit the disease,\u201d said Dr Vijayakumar, head of community medicine at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College. Meanwhile, there has been a let-up in the number of dengue fever cases in the state, but Hepatitis cases are on the rise. Hepatitis A cases are seen more in the northern districts of the state and the southern districts have shown an increase in Hepatitis B cases.  While there were six fever deaths in the state which are suspected to be that from dengue, the total number of confirmed dengue cases have come down to 73 from three digit figures a couple of days ago. Thiruvananthapuram and Idukki districts continued to top the list in the number of dengue cases with confirmed figures of 36 and 16 respectively. In the case of Hepatitis A, Kozhikode had the maximum number of cases at 16. Wayanad reported 6 and Kannur 2. While the southern districts seemed to be relatively free from the incidence of Hepatitis A, what raises concern is the nine confirmed cases from Kollam.  Of the total 35 Hepatitis A cases, there was one case each at Pathanamthitta and Idukki. Hepatitis B has also made its appearance in the state with eight confirmed cases, half of which were from Kollam. Incidentally, Kollam had no dengue cases on Thursday.

The Health Department has stepped up surveillance of diseases and field-level intervention programmes in rural and urban areas.   Visits Officials from the public health wing visited places where the dengue cases have been reported. There are nine suspected cases.  Most of them have been reported from Thiruvambadi, Peruvannamoozhi, Kunduthode, Kunnummal, Nadapuram, Narippatta, Olavanna and Thiruvannur. Thirty-two viral fever patients have been admitted to hospitals. As many as 23,882 patients took treatment at outpatient clinics with suspected symptoms of fever and communicable diseases. As many as 213 patients with diarrhoea took treatment in government and private hospitals.  Meetings District Medical Officer P.K. Mohanan said the constituency-level meetings, headed by the MLAs, were progressing in the district to identify local needs and provide immediate support. Doctors would attend the meetings and report the requirements to the department.  &#8220;We have designed a special health programme for covering regions from where the new dengue cases were reported,&#8221; Dr. Mohanan said. &#8220;To strengthen field intervention and communicable disease control programmes during the monsoon, we have been granted Rs. 7 lakh by the government,&#8221; District Malaria Officer Vimal Raj said. Dr. Raj said Rs. 4 lakh would be utilised for communicable disease control measures and Rs. 3 lakh for the vector-borne disease control programmes.  Cases so far So far in 2013, 43 dengue cases had been confirmed in the district. The number of confirmed leptospirosis cases reached nine, with a fresh one reported from Valiyangadi on Monday.  Till June 10, over 20 lakh people approached various hospitals in the district with communicable and non-communicable diseases. In the group, 53,610 people had viral fever and 13,729 diarrhoea. There were 1,288 Hepatitis A and 20 Hepatitis B cases.  District Medical Department records show 49 confirmed cases of malaria.

The inpatient admission also showed a decline at 377 against Saturday&#8217;s figure of 600.   Officials said there was the possibility that the reporting of cases was incomplete as it was a Sunday, and government labs might not be working in full strength.   With a better dissemination of the dengue management guidelines drawn up by the Health Department, the authorities have been trying to reduce the number of unnecessary referrals of patients to tertiary care centres and encouraging doctors, especially those in the peripheral areas, to manage cases better by classifying the patients into various categories.   Doctors said there was a tendency among doctors to refer a patient to a higher centre as soon as the platelet count dropped below one lakh in order to play safe and avoid possible accusations by patients&#8217; relatives of improper treatment.   While patients are still crowding hospitals, doctors are trying to convince many that they need to be hospitalised only if their symptoms worsen and that dengue is best treated with plenty of rest and oral intake of warm fluids.   Though 87 suspected cases of dengue were reported, there were only four confirmed cases on Sunday. One suspected dengue death was reported from Kottayam.

As most labour camps are located at thickly inhabited areas in the city, the impact of such an outbreak would be severe. \"It is not just the case of Thiruvananthapuram, the labour camps in all parts of the state have to be carefully monitored and steps have to be taken immediately. The IMA has decided to extend support to the local bodies for all kinds of preventive activities,\" said IMA state secretary Dr A V Jaykrishnan. The study finds that majority of migrant labourers consumes contaminated water and lives in unhygienic conditions. The monsoon has added to their misery. Not just malaria, it has also warned of a possible outbreak of leptospirosis in the district since there has been no measure to address the garbage   menace that has become a major cause of concern. The study conducted by the IMA research cell on the morbidity pattern of dengue fever   in the district has found that the rate of complications of dengue fever is as low as 4.2%. The study report prepared by 16 physicians from 11 hospitals after collecting data from 16 hospitals of the district, says that though the percentage of complications and mortality is low, the disease burden is high. \"Hence the prime objective of the government should be the prevention of diseases instead of focusing on treatment oriented activities,\" said chairman of IMA research cell Dr Sreejith N Kumar. Disease control should be the prime focus since the volume of patients is increasing every day. \"Primary care facilities would be adequate to manage vast majority of patients and only those with very low platelets will require advanced care,\" added Dr Sreejith. Although a decrease in platelet count is common in fever cases, the patients recover completely. In the 16 hospitals, about 43.1% of the patients were detected with a platelet count less than 50,000. About 23.6% patients were given platelet transfusion. Only 4.2% patients were detected with major complications like hepatitis, lung injury, etc. The study has observed there no such gross genetic   mutations occurred to the virus and the disease pattern has not shown any significant variation.

But it is also become a reason of worry for the people of state. There has been a sharp increase in the cases of viral fever and dengue since the onset of the monsoon. Since January, more than nine lakh cases of fever have been reported in Kerala with over 2500 confirmed cases of dengue; nine people have lost lives due to dengue and four due to other viral infections. \"With monsoon, the threat from these diseases will only increase along with other infections due to water-logging, inefficient garbage disposal and drainage systems,\" said Dr Gopinath Menon, KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. Dr Menon adds that though there is an increase in number of dengue cases in last two years, the last two months have been particularly bad. KIMS itself has been getting nearly 150 fever cases every day, of which 50% are suspected dengue cases, he says. And to add to the misery of the people of Thiruvananthapuram, city's only garbage disposal plant has been shut down for more than a year. The war of words between LDF-led municipal corporation and UDF-led state government has been continuing without any solution for the common man. Thiruvananthapuram's Mayor K Chandrika has said that the administration is doing what it can. A task force has been set up for clean-up operations, fogging etc. There is a 'result-oriented' effort, the Mayor claims."}

According to sources, facilities are not available to transfer this data from rural centres to the health department.  There are 147 confirmed cases of dengue in Kerala, suggests information available with the Health Department. This is more than last year\u2019s tally. Sources in the department said the number is likely to be even higher as eastern areas like Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha and Kuttampuzha has more cases which are going unnoticed.  \u201cProper coordination of the health department with local bodies is the need of the hour. But the non-cooperation of the local bodies is preventing the health department from approaching the local bodies. Owing to this, the numbers are subdued\u201d, they said. Thirty six cases alone were reported from the areas under Kochi corporation, in addition to 10 from Thrikkakara and 6 from Udayamperoor.  Dr Haseena Mohammad, DMO, refuted it saying that the health officials are also collecting enough materials from the rural areas.  \u201cWe are getting enough data, otherwise we would not have been able to come up with a proper picture\u201d, she said.\u00a0 Sources said that though the health department has initiated measures, it can be regarded as isolated efforts.  \u201cOther than activities like fogging, spraying, they are yet to come up with something substantial. Primary Health centres across the state have to be put into action. Recurring of dengue fever is precarious as it can even cause death\u201d, sources pointed out.  District Administration and the Panchayats, who are equally responsible for monitoring, have not done anything other than organising meetings.\u00a0\u00a0 When asked, District Panchayat President Eldose Kunnappilly said, \u201cWe will sort out the issues in the health adalath which will be conducted on Tuesday\u201d. District Collector P I Sheik Pareeth said that Kudumbasree workers would be employed full time to go to the rural areas to record the reality of the situation.  The sources said that its high time authorities come up with a campaign to eliminate mosquitoes at the source of breeding, in addition to a comprehensive study on the issue.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Bhubaneswar   Dengue spreads wings in capital  The writer has posted comments on this article   is fast spreading in Bhubaneswar. Twelve persons tested positive for the vector-borne disease in the city on Friday, raising the total number of dengue positive people in the capital to 50. In a worrying trend, dengue is being reported from most parts of the city unlike in Cuttack where it is broadly confined to four identified pockets. Around 500 people have tested positive in the state. Of the 12 new positive cases on Friday, three are from BJB Nagar, two from Goutam Nagar, and one each from Banmalipur, Satya Nagar, Gouri Nagar, Rental Colony, Jaydev Vihar, Unit-II and Unit-IV. The highest number of eight persons tested positive from Nayapalli this season. Cases were also reported from Kharavela Nagar, Bapuji Nagar, Baramunda and Shastri Nagar, among other localities. State nodal officer for national vector-borne diseases control programme (NVBDCP) Madan Pradhan said since people commute daily between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, spread of the disease to Bhubaneswar is not surprising. \"We are reviewing the preventive steps on a daily basis with the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation  . People need to be more careful to avert water stagnation around their homes,\" said Pradhan. Municipal health authorities asserted that fogging and spray of anti-larval liquid have been stepped up. \"Around 200 employees were deputed in various localities to check breeding of mosquitoes. Eight fogging machines and 60 sprayers have been pressed into service,\" said city health officer Dr Chandrika Prasad Das. Das said during door-to-door visits, the employees have found that many educated people had kept flower pots in their houses without taking precautions. These are main breeding grounds for aedes, the mosquito that spreads dengue. \"If the dry spell continues, the cases may suddenly rise. Community mobilization to abolish breeding grounds is needed to contain the menace,\" said director of Regional Medical Research Centre S K Kar.

Confirming the increase in dengue cases, Haryana's director health services (malaria) Kamla Singh attributed it to persistent rains, especially in the NCR areas of Gurgaon and Faridabad. \"Though there is a rise in dengue cases due to persistent rains, we have been able to contain the problem with\\ timely action. We have directed medical and paramedical staff to record even those incidences where patients had reported ordinary fever and light symptoms. This could be the reason behind the higher number of cases with suspected symptoms of dengue,\" she said.

This year, only 49 cases have been reported so far. To further control the disease, the Malaria Wing of the UT Administration's Health department has claimed to have undertaken several field operations. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme and Integrated Disease Surveillance Project, under the aegis of Dr S K Bhalla, Director Health and Family Welfare, Chandigarh, conducted a sensitisation training on October 24. The training dealt with prevention, control, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis of dengue for Medical Officers of various health facilities, including officers working under the municipal corporation. As part of preventive measures taken by the department, intensive checks on breeding points such as coolers are being conducted by the health workers in areas being monitored by supervisors and the department itself. As per an official, \"With the upcoming high risk season for transmission of vector borne diseases, the Malaria Wing has geared up field activities for prevention and control of malaria and dengue.\" A team of an Assistant Director (Malaria) along with an epidemiologist visited Manimajra, Maulijagran, Indra Colony, Ram Darbar and Hallomajra to boost up field operations. Giving advisory measures to people an official said, \"In case of fever, a patient should take prescription from a qualified doctor. A blood test for malaria should be done for all fever cases. Free testing and treatment facility is available at all government dispensaries and hospitals.\" Malaria and dengue spread through the bite of mosquitoes found in stagnant and stored water. As a preventive measure, one should not allow water to stagnate in and around houses. Besides this, water should be removed from coolers and other small containers at least once a week. Also, water tanks should be properly covered and discarded containers, tyres, pitchers and pots should not be left on rooftops. People must try and wear full-sleeve clothes, especially during evenings, and use mosquito nets or repellents while sleeping.

The condition is no more limited to chills and fever. The disease is also bringing along dengue-like dip in platelet count and jaundice. Besides Chandigarh, cases are pouring in from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ropar, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Saharanpur (UP), among others. In the last two months, 1,148 samples have been collected from the two hospitals. \"Of these, we found 30 positive for malaria. We have to get other tests and analysis done,\" said Dr Rakesh Sehgal, main investigator, PGI department of medical parasitology. According to the parasitologists, of the five known species of plasmodium parasites - plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium ovale, plasmodium malariae and plasmodium knowlesi - vivax is the most common one with 50-80% prevalence in India. However, it does not result in complications unlike falciparum, which is the most lethal and fatal form. \"We have been approached by medicine specialists at PGI and GMCH who have come across malaria cases in severe forms. These are due to vivax, but the symptoms are similar to the ones caused by falciparum. This is worrying. So we have drafted a research to find the reason for the virulent form of malaria,\" said Dr Sehgal. Cautious about the coming months when there might be a spurt in malaria cases, he said, \"We will go to the areas where the incidence is high. Middle of the coming month will be suitable for the survey as malaria-causing mosquitoes breed during the season.\" The unusual symptoms are baffling the doctors. \"About 90% of our emergency is crowded with malaria cases of severe form. Patients are coming from Karnal, Kurukshetra, Ropar, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Saharanpur (UP), among others,\" said a senior doctor of GMCH department of medicine. Doctors have been seeing such cases since two to three years. Concerned over the increasing number of such patients over the years, PGI's medical parasitology department has initiated a research to find if the genetics of malaria-causing parasite has altered or the response following the malaria bite (on the host, that is, human) has undergone a change. \"We got worried when such cases started pouring in. We have entered into a collaborative study with GMCH to ascertain the cause. Once the cause is known, the problem can be tackled,\" he added. Symptoms: Continuous fever instead of intermittent fever and chills Dip in platelet count Renal failure Respiratory failure Jaundice/anaemia Like H1N1 flu, there is a feeling of being in a confused state Know more The malaria parasite is transmitted by female anopheles mosquitoes, which bite mainly between dusk and dawn. Falciparum malaria may be fatal if treatment is delayed beyond 24 hours after the onset of clinical symptoms.

Unlike gastroenteritis, which is caused mainly due to contaminated water or food, the seasonal stomach flu is airborne and is prevalent during peak summer. Doctors in the city are seeing an increasing number of such cases in children between 9 months and 5 years. \n\n\n\n Its common symptoms include high fever, stomach ache, vomiting and running nose. \"In some cases, high fever can result in convulsions. So we recommend that fever be controlled first,\" said Dr R S Bedi, a paediatrician in the city. Doctors recommend frequent bathing or sponging to control the fever. \"Many parents think that giving bath and placing the baby in AC room will further increase the fever. But this is a myth,\" Dr Bedi added. \n\n\n\n The flu is caused by bacteria and viruses. However, the prevalent stomach flu is due to viruses which breed during high temperature and humidity. \"If you feel weak and dizzy, you may be dehydrated. In such conditions one also tends to lose fluids through fever, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Salts lost during the loss of fluids must be replenished with electrolyte drinks,\" said Dr Prabha Sharma, a physician in Panchkula. \n\n\n\n As the flu is airborne, there is no way to prevent it. \"We advise personal hygiene, intake of sufficient fluids and cold surroundings,\" said Dr Kuldeep Bakshi of Mohali. \n\n\n\n \"The flu is viral and subsides in five to six days. For this, we do not recommend antibiotics. Only fever must be controlled so that it does not rise to the level of convulsions,\" Dr Sharma added."}

The maximum number of cases were reported from Kamrup (metro) with about 1466 cases. B K Baruah, joint director malaria   and state programme officer of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVDCP), said, \"With the change in temperature, dengue cases are decreasing slowly. The disease spreads its tentacles during July-August when the climate is extremely hot in the beginning and then it starts to rain. But during September-October, the disease stops spreading because of the fall   in the temperature. The aedes mosquitoes cannot breed during winter.\" The medical officer added that temperature plays a very important role in the spread   of the disease. This year, the state experienced extreme weather conditions so the disease was at its highest during August. But last year, during August the number of cases reported from different parts of the state was very less. \"The detection this year was more as compared to last year due to improvement in diagnostic facilities. Apart from that, awareness has also increased in the people and those with symptoms like fever and headache   directly went for blood sample testing or consulting a doctor without any delay. As a result, the number of cases detected was more but now the trend is decreasing,\" he said. He added, this year, fogging operations started in the month of January-February after several dengue cases and deaths came to light last year.

At least nine students, studying in Class IV and V, of the school were taken ill after consuming the same pills and shifted to district headquarters hospital after their condition worsened. Preliminary reports suggest the students were given a higher dose of the medicine. They complained of nausea and vomiting and some even fainted. \"The students are out of danger. We found that they were given medicines meant for adults,\" chief district medical officer (Balangir) Bikrant Kindo, adding, \"We have asked all schools to stop giving the medicine.\" The doctors also suspect the students had the medicine on an empty stomach. The school authorities, however, said they were given the tablets after the midday meal. \"We were not specifically told that the tables were for adults,\" said headmaster of the school Muralidhar Sahu. Meanwhile, the health department has started probing the incident in which 176 students of Gopinathpur UG ME School in Puri's Jadupur village fell ill after consuming the tablets. \"I have asked the drug controller to check the manufacturing details of the iron supplements supplied to the school,\" said health minister Damodar Rout. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik   had asked the district collector to conduct a thorough probe and submit a report as soon as possible. \"The probe will begin once all students are discharged from the hospital,\" said collector (Puri) Naba Kumar Nayak. As many as 19 students are still under observation at the Puri district headquarters hospital. The chief district medical officer Gyanedra Sahu, who visited the school on Wednesday, said, \"Despite instructions, the teachers gave the tablets to children on an empty stomach, leading to the adverse drug reaction.\" School and mass education minister Rabi Narayan Nanda said, \"The incident has come as a surprise. The tablets were supplied by the health department. We will have a joint meeting with the health department on Thursday to find the exact reason behind the incident.\" Supply of iron supplements to schools is part of a government initiative to arrest anaemia among the young population.

However, several others diagnosed with the ailment are reportedly under treatment at private nursing homes.\n\nThe MLA asked the erring healthcare units to comply with the Clinical Establishment Act and send in timely reports on the number of dengue cases, failing which the state health department could move to cancel their licenses.\n\nMeanwhile, local Trinamool leaders continued to engage in a blame game with top civic officials of the Congress-run SMC over the unrelenting march of dengue in the area.\n\nWhile mayor Gangotri Dutta blamed the state health department for failing to contain the spread of the disease, local Trinamool leaders put the onus on the civic body, saying it lacked the urgency to deal with the situation."}

A majority of these cases were reported from the densely populated City taluka, followed by Latifabad. Meanwhile, the health authorities claimed that at least three fumigation sprays have been carried out in the district since late July. The fourth phase, scheduled to start on October 7, was delayed due to a lack of funds. The campaign was supposed to be carried out after every fortnight to prevent mosquito larvae from growing up. The residents dismissed, however, these claims and insisted that their neighbourhoods seldom see any sanitisation. \u201cWe read in newspapers and watch on television that the health authorities are staging awareness walks at the start of the fumigation campaign but we hardly find any vehicle spraying chemicals in our area,\u201d admitted Danish Malik, a resident of Liaquat Colony, a neighbourhood in City taluka, where the largest number of dengue cases \u2014 270 \u2014 emerged. In view of such public outcry and complaints, district and sessions judge Aijaz Khaskheli ordered the authorities on October 9 to perform fumigation in the presence of a court-nominated citizen. According to the order, applicant Tajamul Khan or his nominees have been authorised to certify sanitisation in each part of the district. However, the court order has not been complied with so far while the district administration has formed its own fumigation plan that will start from October 22. Dr Abbassi told a press conference on Monday that they will ensure optimal results this time around. \u201cWe have formed 10 teams led by four sub-divisional magistrates, four Mukhtiarkars, four doctors and four municipality officials,\u201d he explained. \u201cUnlike the past, we will start it from one taluka followed by another instead of simultaneously doing it in the whole district.\u201d He admitted that the district did not have proper fumigation in the past, but he blamed the local government and the town municipal authorities for this. \u201cThe health department only provides chemicals and machines. The vehicles, fuel and staff in addition to doing spray in the areas is not our responsibility.\u201d The local government department\u2019s assistant director, Aijaz Bhutto, told The Express Tribune that their drive for early October was delayed due to a lack of funds. Sindh information minister Sharjeel Memon, however, got approved Rs5 million for fumigation from the chief secretary, he added. \u201cWe will make sure that each locality is sprayed with the chemicals and that no complain surfaces,\u201d he promised. Khan said he has yet to be consulted despite the authorities being bound by the order. According to sources in the health department, there is a dearth of technicians trained to make the chemical mix for fumigation but Dr Abbassi claimed they have 32 trained technicians for the job.

XXXXXX December 16 gang-rape: Verdict involving juvenile deferred Taxi driver shot dead in Manipur Volcanic eruption coats Japanese city with ash  Malaria rises by 30 percent in Vizag, most cases in slums   Ayesha Minhaz | ENS - VISAKHAPATNAM  19th August 2013 11:37 AM  A jump of over 30 per cent has been witnessed in the number of malaria cases reported in the limits of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) this year.  One of the major reasons for this is being stated as the stagnant water near slum settlements, drains and construction sites.  Most of the cases are reported from slums and settlements near construction sites where people store water in open vessels which facilitates mosquito breeding, said officials.  Also, large pits dug up near construction sites for the purpose of storing water for the works are seldom closed, and this adds to the problem.  District malaria officer KVS Prasad Rao said, \u201cThe rise is not abnormal. Unlike in rural areas where breeding happens mostly after spells of rain, the use of artificial containers and presence of slums makes the city an ideal abode for these parasites.\u201d  The situation now is better than what it was a decade ago or even five years ago. \u201cThe minimum number of cases however cannot be reduced due to the said factors,\u201d he explained.  Over 2,200 cases have been reported in the district till July this year. Officials from King George Hospital (KGH) confirmed 17 malaria deaths till date this year. Last year, 26 deaths and 3,000 cases of malaria were reported, and more than half of the cases came from Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) areas of Visakhapatnam, according to statistics available with district medical and health officer Dr R Syamala.  The number of cases in the tribal pockets of the district, however, has gone down this year. The DMHO attributes this to less rainfall. \u201cWe take up two rounds of spraying in the tribal and rural areas every year during this season. One round has been completed and the second will be taken up after the northeast spell,\u201d she said. The sprayings in the city limits are done by GVMC officials.  \u201cIt is difficult to perform the operations regularly in the city and on the outskirts,\u201d added GVMC biologist Y Mani. The GVMC has a special team to implement the vector control measures like anti-larval operations, spraying and fogging.  There has not been much difference in the number of dengue fever cases reported when compared to last\u00a0 year. However, a dengue fever death seems to have escaped the database of DMHO officials who keep track of the seasonal fevers and measures taken to counter it.  Officials of KGH said that there was one dengue fever death and around 13 reported cases at KGH alone this year. But right now there are no cases of dengue fever at KGH.

Officials from the three municipal corporations are said to have intensified fumigation efforts. \"We are working on ensuring fumigation efforts continue regularly, and reporting is regular. There is no reason to panic as these are annual diseases, where numbers start increasing after the monsoons,\" a health official from the South Municipal Corporation said.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Hyderabad   Malaria cases see alarming jump in city  The writer has posted comments on this article   HYDERABAD: Barely days into monsoon and the city has already witnessed an alarming jump in malaria cases, laying bare the poor vector control preparation by civic authorities. About 86 malaria cases   have been reported from Hyderabad in the last two weeks and 213 cases from across the state during the past week, officials said. About 4,974 malaria cases have been reported since January this year across the state, with Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram being the worst affected districts, they said. The southwest monsoon covered Hyderabad last week and immediately exposed the poor planning on the part of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation   (GHMC) regarding water logging and disease control. Hyderabad district health officials said malaria cases are being reported from areas along the riverbeds and small lakes, including Puranapul, Uppuguda and Amberpet. Cases have also been reported from Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills, along with Tolichowki and Mehdipatnam. \"We have come across some severe cases of malaria. We are getting almost one case a day. Small clinics and nursing homes must be getting more,\" said B Vijay Kumar, senior physician, Yashoda Hospital, Secunderabad. Choked drains, potholed roads, stagnant water and construction sites in the city are the breeding grounds for mosquitoes. While GHMC officials claim that fogging and anti-larval operations are being undertaken wherever required to curb the mosquito menace year after year, there seems to be no respite for denizens. Experts say that the annual malaria outbreaks can be effectively controlled if things are planned in an organized way by health officials. But acute shortage of health staff has become a major obstacle. \"We are treating patients based on clinical signs. It is difficult to identify malaria as most patients come to us after getting treatment outside,\" said Prof K Narsimulu, general medicine, Gandhi Hospital. Meanwhile, Poonam Malakondaiah, commissioner of health and family welfare in a media conference on Wednesday said the government has declared June as anti-malaria and anti-diarrhoea month and is organizing massive awareness programmes. She said rallies and public meetings would be held across the state and spraying operations in 3,214 villages out of 6,954 malaria prone villages have been completed. \"Sufficient drugs have been made available in all the districts to ensure early diagnosis and prompt treatment,\" she said.

So far this year, 110 people have been suspected with 16 testing positive for dengue. It has led to two deaths.   The administration has launched a dengue control operation in Arera Colony   on Saturday. Arera Colony continued to be the epicentre of dengue outbreak this year with 10 cases reporting from the locality. According to district malaria   office (DMO), two of the four new cases are from E-7 Arera Colony, while one each from Saket Nagar and Ayodhya Bypass. Condition of two is reported to be critical. Saturday's positive cases once again dented the administration's claim on dengue control. Some 150 DMOs and district administration staffers participated in a dengue control operation in affected slums at Arera Colony on Saturday. To get rid of dengue causing larvae, water supply to Sai Baba Nagar and Meera Colony was disconnected. \"Water from utensils and tanks that were breeding larvae was emptied and preventive spray of insecticide was carried out,\" said district DMO Dr KB Vajpai. Contradicting knee-jerk reaction of administration, Gandhi Medical College department of microbiology HoD Dr Deepak Dubey said, \"Action during rain does not last long enough, most of the chemical sprays would be washed away. Preventive measures are effective pre-monsoon.\" Health officials however claimed that Saturday's clean-up drive would control dengue cases   and a 2009-like outbreak is unlikely, when the city reported 332 dengue cases and over three dozen dengue related deaths were reported.

From a level of 22 fresh cases every single day during the months of September to November last year when the epidemic was peaking in the city, incidents of dengue have come down to between zero and two per day during the first week of January. Even though, at 460, the total number of dengue cases here had increased compared to the previous two years of 2011 and 2010 when 248 and 152 cases were recorded, respectively, Deputy Director of Health Services R. Damodharan informed that Coimbatore \u2014 along with Salem, Theni and Tiruchi \u2014 had the lowest incidences of dengue in 2012 when the epidemic struck across the State. Speaking to The Hindu , he said the disease was focused only in some blocks of the district. The primary health centres that recorded the highest number of cases were located at Thudiyalur (49 cases), Pugalur (22) and Somanur (21). Among the measures adopted to monitor dengue outbreak, he said, was to extend the Health Department\u2019s surveillance from government health institutions alone to include private hospitals capable of treating the disease. The private institutions were instructed to provide data on dengue on a daily basis to the Department. Further, a dedicated telephone line \u2014 (0422) 222 0041 \u2014 was also established for the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, which functioned 24 X 7, when the dengue cases were peaking, to receive information from the public on dengue cases in their locality. A Rapid Action Team (RAT) was also formed to reach the areas of dengue outbreaks expeditiously. The authorities closely monitored the vector indices such as House Index, which measured the extent of mosquito breeding, and Breteau Index, used to evaluate the strategies adopted to control mosquitoes. Dr. Damodharan said that Health Inspectors conducted regular surveys in their blocks and all persons who had fever that persisted for more than four days were administered platelets."}

A few hours after they took the food, some students started vomiting and complained of nausea. They were immediately admitted in Chandrapur health centre and soon 50 more students complained of similar ailment and the district health officials were informed about the matter. Later in the night, 22 of 50 students were shifted from Chandrapur health centre to Muniguda hospital.

From 11 cases in July, the highest till then, the figure for dengue has jumped to 142, which has been attributed to intermittent rains and stable temperature building conducive mosquitogenic conditions but no death has been reported so far, according to an MCD report released. &ldquo;The peak for dengue cases is generally during September end but due to intermittent rains last month, the temperature got stabilised to about 25 degree Celsius, conducive for breeding of related mosquitoes and hence the manifold rise,&rdquo; North Delhi and East Delhi public relations officer Yogendra Singh Mann said.   There were only 20 cases of dengue from January to July, while March and May posted none. For Delhi region, in the January-August period, a total of 152 dengue cases were reported, while 10 were reported from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other states, the report said. Figures for various corporations are &mdash; North (90), South (36) and East (13). Thirteen cases were reported from regions in Delhi outside the jurisdiction of MCD. Most number of cases came were from Rohini (31) and Narela (32) in North Zone. Malaria cases also rose to 24 in August against 18 in July. Mann said that preventive measures were being stepped up.&nbsp; The number of legal notices issued on detection of mosquito breeding on premises from January to August stood at 79,738 as compared to 43,374 last year over the same period, the report said. &ldquo;We are continuing with our anti-larval routines with Malaria inspectors working in each zones. Our domestic breeding checkers are going from door to door to alert people to take precautionary and preventive measures. Fumigation is being carried out along Yamuna banks. We have also released fish in certain areas, so that they consume the mosquito larvae,&rdquo; he said. Regular activation and sensitisation plans have been going on and camps are being organised to educate people about the disease and the measures to be taken by them. &ldquo;We are expecting a dry spell and temperature change might affect breeding again. So, we are on alert. Also, we will be running &lsquo;terminator trains&rsquo; in uninhabited areas, where water stagnates and we will be spraying fumes,&rdquo; Mann said.

Almost all the students, who were admitted to seven different hospitals yesterday, were discharged today. The cases of school students falling ill in the city came close on the heels of mid-day meal tragedies in two Bihar schools and the death of a child after taking Vitamin A tablets at an anganwadi centre in that state. \"21 students had been admitted to the hospitals and around 200 students reported some kind of side effects,\" Delhi Health Minister A K Walia said adding that a total of 15 lakh students were given the folic acid and iron supplements yesterday under a scheme of Union Health Ministry. Walia said it is not unusual to have side effects like stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting when initial doses of iron and folic acid are given. \"World-wide these symptoms are documented to be experienced by people in the initial doses of iron and folic acid tablet,\" he said. \"The percentage of students reporting side effects is 0.01 per cent which is well within the acceptable levels,\" he said adding all systemic preparations for managing such side effects have been put in place. The scheme to provide iron and folic acid tablets was kicked off yesterday to improve the health of students studying in schools. Under the programme all adolescent children in 6 to 12th standard at government and government aided schools will be given iron and folic acid tablets once a week. Walia said in addition to 15 lakh students, around two lakh adolescents under anganwadi centres and one lakh teachers and anganwadi workers, were also given the folic acid and iron supplements. Officials said 21 students, including 16 girl students, were admiited to seven hospitals and none of the patients was reported to be in a serious condition. A maximum of eight students were admitted to Sunder Lal Jain hospital while seven students were admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital. Two patients each were admitted to Jag Pravesh Chander hospital and Hindu Rao hospital. One student each was admitted to Hedgewar Aorgya Sansthan and BR Ambedkar hospital. The officials said around 200 other students who reported sick were also checked by doctors in the schools. Medical Superintendent of Sundarlal Hospital Subhash Aggarwal said 8 students in the age group of 10-12 years were brought to the hospital yesterday by the local police. They all had the common complaint of abdomen pain and vomiting. He said the following treatment, students were discharged early this morning. \"We carried out stomach wash of the students besides normal medical treatment,\" Aggarwal said. DCP North West P Karunakaran said the students complained that they fell ill after taking the tablets given in the school. \"An investigation into the case is on,\" he said. The incident comes a day after one child died and 21 other children fell ill after taking vitamin A tablets given to them at an anganwadi centre in Bihar's Gaya district. 23 children have also died due to eating contaminated mid-day meal in two Bihar schools."}

Till date, at least 15 cases of dengue have been confirmed at the Public Health Centres (PHC) there, and three at private hospitals. \n\nGiven that the population is only 1,700 in Jaiprakash Nagar, the number of cases is being viewed seriously by the administration. Since the declaration of outbreak on October 24, district health officer Dr Nandakumar Deshmukh has visited the area twice, including on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have already started taking precautions on a large scale, and now the situation is coming under control. The number of positive cases has decreased,\u201d said Dr Deshmukh.\n\n\u201cTill now, we have fumigated the area thrice to control the adult mosquitoes population, as well as the larvae.  We have also introduced a large number of guppy fish, which eat mosquito larvae,\u201d said Dr Sanjeev Jadhav, additional district health officer.\n\nAlarm bells went off when nearly 55 people reported fever and showed dengue-like symptoms. Immediately after the ZP received reports of three patients with dengue being admitted to a private hospital, they did a field survey to screen for dengue. A clinic and a control unit were established with immediate effect, and tests for dengue, which were initially not available there, were made available there.\n\nLocals also convened a special gramsabha on October 27, and the next day, all households observed a \u2018dry\u2019 day. The ZP has also established a special isolation ward at the PHC in Khadakwasla, besides sending blood samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for suspected cases, health officials said.\n\n\u201cAll patients are stable now. I have even discharged two of them as they had mostly recovered. More will be discharged soon. There is only one woman patient who was critical, and showed a platelet count of 10,000 on the first day of the outbreak. She is admitted to a private hospital,\u201d said Dr Jyoti Kole, medical officer, Khadakwasla PHC."}

While residents were screened for various ailments, a fumigation drive was carried out in areas like Mohan Nagar, Bhim Nagar, Shivkrupa society, Shastri Nagar, ONGC colony and MIG colony. According to Prakash Wani, a resident of Rajawadi colony in Ghatkopar, most residents are worried about the sudden rise in dengue cases in the past one month. \"I know more than 20 people who are currently being treated in Rajawadi hospital for dengue. A few more have also been admitted to Sant Muktabai hospital,\" he said. There are six hospitals (including two municipal hospitals) in the ward. A local corporator, Pravin Chheda, said more than 80 dengue cases have been reported from four private hospitals. \"The BMC's count of dengue cases is lower than the actual count as there is no coordination between private hospitals and the civic department,\" Chheda said. He said an eight-year-old girl succumbed to dengue in a private hospital earlier this month, but her death was not reported. However, BMC's deputy executive health officer, Dr Mangala Gomare, said three confirmed cases of dengue were reported from the ward in October and there were 18 suspected cases reported from private hospitals. According to pest control officer of N-ward, Dr Lalchand Wagh, the breeding spots have increased since September . \"In September, we had recorded 145 breeding spots. However, the count has risen to 178 this month. About 45 per cent spots were found indoors,\" he said.

Berri declined to comment on the SDM's claims but said the 25 positive blood samples were all from Batala. \"There were some suspected cases (from Batala) as well at the Gurdaspur Civil Hospital (testing centre), definitely,\" he said.

Ravi Kumar of Gandhi Camp, Happy of Bhandari Mohalla, Satnam Singh of Thathiari Mohalla and Avinash Chander of Lanwian Mohalla were admitted to the local civil hospital, while more than eight people were admitted to private hospitals with dengue fever-like symptoms. Even as three people, including a woman, reportedly died of dengue in Amritsar hospitals, the administration refused to confirm the cause of death. Senior medical officer Sukhdeep Singh said, \"The three people died in hospitals in Amritsar. They did not approach the civil hospital here, and we did not examine or diagnose them, so we cannot say for certain what the cause of their deaths was.\" Ill-equipped Patients at the civil hospital complained about shortage of syringes and medicines, alleging that in spite of three deaths, the administration failed to get a platelet cell count machine, forcing them to approach private laboratories for the expensive test, which has to be done twice a day. As most of the patients approaching the civil hospital belong to the low-income group, the shortage added to their woes. Patients accused the health department of not maintaining the hospital properly, adding that all the washrooms and general wards were quite dirty. Besides, only three of more than 15 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital were provided with mosquito nets, they alleged. Sources in the health department said that every day, nearly 50 people with dengue-like symptoms were approaching the civil hospital, but due to some undisclosed reasons, doctors were avoiding admitting them, and were sending them back. Only those people whose platelet cell count had dropped to below 75,000 were admitted. The sanitation condition of the city has not improved yet either. A survey of the city showed that garbage was piled high in most localities, and water was overflowing due to choking of sewage pipes at Thathairi Gate, making it the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, which carry dengue, malaria and other disease-causing germs. Talking to HT, Youth Against Corruption district coordinator Ajay Rekhi blamed the civil administration for the outbreak, and said that due to the \"non-seriousness\" of the officials of the health and civil administration towards tackling the problem, it had spiralled out of control. \"Responsibility should be fixed and action taken against the erring officials,\" he demanded. Executive officer Manmohan Singh Randhawa claimed that he had deputed more than 24 people to carry out fogging in the city, and especially in the inner city, and appealed to people to drain out stagnant water lying in their areas."}

Goregaon's Shastri Nagar area has emerged as a dengue pit this season, with more than 30 patients from here getting hospitalised for the disease over the last fortnight. The civic body however, refuses to acknowledge this outbreak and insists that they have only suspected cases of dengue. Dr Devidas Sheregar, a senior physician from the area attached to the Kapadia Hospital, told Mumbai Mirror that 20 patients from the locality were admitted under him during the last two weeks. \"I did not have any cases till about August 10. But suddenly the patients started pouring in after that,\" said Sheregar, adding that all the 20 patients have tested positive in the antigen NS1 and IGM tests for dengue. \"There must be several younger patients admitted under the pediatrician here, as well as many in other hospitals around,\" said Sheregar who discharged four of his patients on Monday. Kapadia hospital currently has six patients under treatment for the mosquito-borne disease. Thirty six year old Babita Tyagi was rushed to hospital on Sunday after she collapsed from high fever and weakness. An NS1 test done on her showed positive. Her nine-year-old son Utkarsh and 29-year-old brother Vaibhav were also detected with dengue and were discharged from hospital only last week. \"Many other residents from ours as well as the neighboring building have tested positive for the disease,\" said Tyagi's husband Satyendra. Another resident of the area, Mallika Pujari, 32 was discharged from the hospital on Sunday. She too had tested positive for dengue. Her husband, Satish had recovered from the disease and was discharged from the Kokilaben Hospital only last Wednesday. \"Since the dengue mosquito breeds in clean water and domestic premises, we removed all plants from our home long ago. But there has to be some other clean water-breeding spot in the area which may be the root cause,\" said Satish. Civic officials had visited 43-year-old Nalini Patil's house to look for breeding spots but did not find any. Patil had been down with dengue and had been discharged only on Monday. \"I was down with fever and severe body ache but the initial antigen NS1 test came negative for the first three days. Then I was advised to do the IGM test which showed positive,\" said Patil who was hospitalised for two days after her platelet count fell to 91000. Normal platelet count is between 150,000 and 450,000 per microlitre. A BMC official said the antigen NS1 test is a rapid test which is not considered as a confirmatory one. \"There are chances for it to show as false positive quite often and therefore we do not consider it confirmatory. Only the elisa tests like IGM etc give a confirmed positive report,\" said BMC's epidemiologist Mangala Gomare, adding that so far they have reports for only five suspected dengue patients from the area. Dr Sheregar however said that a positive antigen NS1 test clubbed with the classical dengue symptoms are enough for confirmation. Why is dengue becoming deadly? Medical experts say that increasingly, dengue patients are coming in with severe complications and need ICU care. Two out of Dr Sheregar's 20 dengue patients of the last fortnight needed ICU admission. The inflammatory cells produced by the dengue virus enter various organs in body leading to the severe complications. Recently, a 23-year-old woman was detected with low heart function because of dengue, after the cells entered her cardiac muscles. \"There is definitely some kind of mutation in the virus because the cases we are getting are far past the regular types. The patients are coming with drastically low platelet count, liver problems, low pulse etc. The symptoms are now more than just the regular fever and muscle pain,\" said physician Dr Pratit Samdani, who recently saw a dengue patient with a platelet count as low as 8000.

This is almost half the number of dengue cases the city has recorded since the onset of monsoon. On Monday alone, six cases of dengue were reported from here.  Over a month ago, 26-year-old Tanmay Karnik, a resident of Shastri Nagar, was admitted at Suvidha Hospital for dengue. He was the first victim of the disease in his locality. Several other residents of the colony reported positive for dengue later. In addition, the area has been witness to two cases of leptospirosis and four cases of malaria.  Shastri Nagar consists of 26 buildings with more than 4,000 residents. Currently, there are 10 dengue patients admitted at Kapadia Hospital, seven in Siddharth Hospital, two in Bhagwati, two in Jain, and 14 in Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital.  Dhawal Shah, 30, a resident of Shashtri Nagar, said, \"We hear about three to four new cases every day. With a lot of construction going on near-by, water accumulates on the roadside. This is one of the reasons for mosquitoes breeding.\"  NCP member Sukhdeo Karande said, \"Right behind the colony, there are two slums, Laxmi Nagar and Bhagat Singh Nagar. These also contribute to breeding of mosquitoes.\"  The pumping station in the area is old and does not function properly. \"Water in drains cannot be washed out if pumping is not powerful,\" he said.  Chief Medical Officer in Siddharth Hospital, Dr Avinash Sankhe, said, \"Mosquito eggs are washed away in running water. However, that colony has several spots with stagnant water. This makes it easy for mosquitoes to multiply.\"  Last year, the civic health department reported 16,086 dengue cases in the city. This year, there have been 381 cases, with 120 since the onset of monsoon. Of the 120 cases, almost 50 per cent are from Shastri Nagar.   ... contd.

A total of 755 dengue cases have been reported from Haryana, out of which Gurgaon district is the worst affected with a total 250 cases and 212 cases in Faridabad Haryana's Director Health Services (Malaria), Dr Kamla Singh said, districts like Karnal and Yamunanagar are also among the worst affected. So far two deaths have been reported due to the vector-borne disease--one each in Sonepat and Kaithal, she said. \"We have sent an advisory to all district hospitals on the line of treatment to the patients. The health department had got into action since June, spreading awareness about the disease and urging people to avoid improper water storage,\" Singh said. Unlike last year, when dengue cases were registered only at the beginning of October, this year the outbreak was reported earlier with monsoon arriving in mid-June in Haryana, three weeks earlier than its normal schedule, she noted. Fogging is being carried out in the areas where dengue cases have been reported, she said, adding, their efforts must be supplemented by the civic authorities to maintain cleanliness and drain out stagnant water. \"We have sent out a communication to Deputy Commissioners and the civic bodies to put in more efforts to keep the localities clean,\" she added. In 2010, 866 dengue cases were reported in the state with 21 deaths, out of which Gurgaon alone accounted for 631 cases and 13 deaths. In 2011, only 267 cases with three deaths were reported in the state, they said."}

Every case in which blood platelet count drops is not dengue. But a fear of sort is being spread among patients even before conducting required blood tests. All precautionary measures should be taken, but private hospitals have been told to refrain from any exaggeration,\" Dr Pushpa Bishnoi, civil surgeon of Gurgaon told TOI.\n\n \n\n \"Contrary to some media reports, no dengue death has occurred in Gurgaon so far,\" she added.\n\n \n\n While the official number of dengue cases in Gurgaon was 176, private hospitals claimed the actual number was at least twice as much. Some hospitals said they were running out of beds due to spike in dengue cases. NGOs and health activists estimate that there have been more than 300 dengue cases so far.\n\n \n\n \"The health department is underplaying the numbers. They and civic agencies have failed in taking sufficient preventive measures like fumigation and clearing stagnated water,\" said a doctor from a private hospital.\n\n \n\n \"If things are not brought under control, we are headed for an epidemic-like situation. Despite adding beds, we are failing to meet the demand,\" he added.\n\n \n\n Gurgaon has 18 big hospitals, apart from smaller nursing homes and clinics, with a total strength of around 5,000 beds. When TOI called some of these hospitals, they revealed that they were running out of beds as patients from Delhi, Faridabad and neighbouring districts were also being admitted.\n\n \n\n Lack of facilities related to immediate treatment and non-availability of equipment for separating platelets in the Civil Hospital has put residents at the receiving end. Health authorities accepted the non-availability of platelet separators, but insisted that the arrangements have been made with private hospitals.\n\n \n\n \"We don't have blood platelet separation machine. But private hospitals have agreed to provide this service at confessional rates for patients referred from Civil hospital. BPL patients will get this service free of cost,\" said Dr Bishnoi.\n\n \n\n Even according to official figures, Gurgaon has reported the highest number of dengue cases in Haryana. The RWAs and NGOs blame health authorities, civic bodies for their failure in running awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of the disease caused by breeding of mosquitoes in fresh and clean water stored for more than four days.\n\n \n\n \"Gurgaon district is the worst affected with a total of 176 cases of dengue detected till date. A total of 383 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported this year as compared with 87 cases in the corresponding period last year from the state,\" a state health department official said.\n\n \n\n Keeping in view the rise in cases of dengue in Gurgaon, the Haryana health department on Wednesday further strengthened its efforts to control the spread of the disease. A meeting via video-conferencing was held with the district officials to take stock of the situation and to issue necessary instructions to field units, said Dr Narender Arora, director general health services.\n\n \n\n The director of health services (malaria) also interacted with civil surgeons and other senior functionaries of dengue-prone districts to review preparations.\n\n"}

Though the district health department has not confirmed any dengue deaths, there is a discrepancy in the number of dengue cases and deaths reported by private hospitals and those registered by the health department.  According to the doctors at Artemis hospital, a man succumbed to dengue here three weeks ago. The patient was a resident of DLF City. He came to the hospital with dengue haemorrhagic fever, one of the last stages of the vector-borne disease, doctors said.  In this stage, the victim goes into a shock and tends to bleed to death. Another man also died at the Gurgaon Civil hospital around the same time. \"He projected signs of dengue, one of them being high-grade fever. But we could not test his sample as he died within half an hour of admission,\" said an official at the dengue-malaria department of the health department.  Commenting on the confusion over death figures, the district civil surgeon, Pushpa Bishnoi, said, \"At private hospitals, the dengue samples are tested using a rapid test method, which, at times, wrongly declares the sample to be positive. Only samples that are tested positive under the confirmatory test at the Civil hospital are considered positive. So far, not a single death has occurred in the district.\"  Meanwhile, the malaria count also reached 153 in the district on Tuesday.  As Gurgaon - referred to as the state's dengue-malaria capital last year- witnesses an increase in the number of vector-borne diseases, the deputy director for dengue and malaria is likely to visit the city on Thursday. \"It is a routine visit by the official. He will be visiting all the affected areas,\" said Bishnoi.  Last year, a team from Panchkula had visited Gurgaon to examine the 'epidemic-like' situation. The department had registered 469 cases with one death. The team had even listed posh residential localities of DLF City Phase 3, South City 1, Sushant Lok 1, Sector 15 and Palam Vihar among others as the dengue hotspots.

Hospital authorities issued a statement saying that there was no reason to panic.  Shanti Devi, a resident of Bhondsi, admitted her daughter Ranjana twice at the Civil Hospital. Devi said: \"Ranjana had been complaining of abdominal pain since she had the iron tablet in school. She was discharged after medication but the pain kept coming back. The doctor told us that it was normal and that she would get well soon.\"  According to Sunita Rathi, Deputy Civil Surgeon and in-charge of the WIPS programme, said: \"There were about 31 cases reported from Bhondsi and Sohna, where the children required immediate medical attention as they suffered from vomiting, dehydration, headache and abdominal pain. But they reported mild symptoms and were treated at the hospital and subsequently discharged. We visited a school in Bhondsi, where a student was put on a glucose drip when it was not required. Gradually, when word spread that other cases were being reported, even the mild cases that could be treated in a Public Health Centre were referred to the hospital. It was more psychological than physical. Most of the children were discharged in a few hours. It must be noted that the pill must be consumed after a meal with lots of water.\"  Following the controversy over the iron tablet, doctors as well as district administration officials held a meeting on Wednesday to chart the course of action on the programme.  Dr Pushpa Bishnoi, CMO (Civil Hospital), Gurgaon said: \"A total of 62,853 students were given these tablets in Gurgaon and of them, only 163 students reported mild stomach ache or giddiness. We cannot stop this programme because a negligible number of students reported mild side-effects. No child reported any serious problem.

The cases were reported from Paras, Medanta- The medicity, Alchemist and Artemis hospital. The age-bracket of patients vary from 19-31years and one of the patient is a women. It being the most conducive season for mosquito borne diseases, the July month is globally observed as anti-dengue month, said an official from health department. As aedes aegypti mosquitoes causing dengue fever   breeds in stagnated water, the rising number of the cases also reveals lack of precautions by the residents. \"The results are quite shocking because we had organized awareness programs in several suspected areas, but people clearly seemed to have ignored the signs and failed to follow the preventive measures. Sadly, even educated people are heedless towards the precautions and later blame it on the civic authorities. Therefore, we are planning awareness workshops for malaria in residential colonies and also in villages like Basai, Khandsa etc. It being the peak season for malaria, we expect a rise in mosquito borne diseases in the coming months,\" said Dr Mahendra Gupta, district malaria officer. \"Surprisingly dengue is on rise in most urban areas like Sector-10, DLF city   phase III, South city, Sector- 56, Sector-54, Sector-40 and Sector-30 which reflects people's indifference and mindless attitude,\" he added.

If private hospitals' reports are to be taken into consideration, the figure for dengue fever   broke all previous records. Besides that there was no slowdown in malaria   cases in 2012 drawing attention to poor sanitation conditions of the city. Health department officials said that 469 cases of dengue and one death were reported in 2012, while 599 malaria cases and six swine flu   cases were reported this year. However, according to private hospitals, around 2,000 dengue cases had been reported, besides seven deaths. Last year, 156 dengue cases were reported. The huge gap in figures the government and private hospitals reflected defensive attitude of the district health department rather than focusing on preventive measures. Moreover, despite a provision to make available platelets to dengue patients at the Civil Hospital  , this was not done at the hospital and patients were referred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. It was not until TOI highlighted the matter that the health department sought a report from the hospital administration in the matter. Doctors were asked to implement the guidelines in letter and spirit. Apart from doctor's laxity, patients, knowing that it has to be arranged from outside, not taking any chances, prefer to get admitted to other hospitals or referred to Delhi. When asked about the arrangements department is going to do for the coming year so that such a situation does not arise, Gurgaon civil surgeon Praveen Garg said the hospital is planning to have its own plasma separator to provide platelet to dengue patients. In absence of plasma separator at the Civil Hospital, patients are dependent on private hospitals. Garg added that they focus on sensitization programmes as well. There had been no decrease in malaria cases in 2012.

Healthy ministry officials, however, said such mild reactions have been documented among first-time users worldwide.  \"Worldwide, one per cent of users experience mild symptoms when iron and folic acid supplements are taken for the first time,\" Health Minister A K Walia said. He said the body gradually adjusts to the intake and the symptoms were no cause for alarm.  Nearly 16 lakh students in Delhi government schools were provided iron folic acid supplements on Wednesday.  The Directorate of Education (DoE), together with the Directorate of Health, had distributed these tablets to help counter iron deficiency and anaemia. The tablets are to be taken every Wednesday.  According to a DoE official, the students felt a little uneasy in the night after taking the supplements post lunch. They were admitted to nearby hospitals and were discharged the same night. The Education department said the students may have got a stomach flu, possibly because of a 'minor reaction to the folic acid'.  \"On Wednesday around  8 pm, some students complained of abdominal pain and vomiting. They said they fell ill after taking the tablets. Based on their parents' complaint, a case of causing hurt under Section 337 of the IPC has been registered at the Bharat Nagar police station of Northwest Delhi. The tablets and vomiting samples have been sent for a forensic examination,\" a police officer said.

Delhi health minister A K Walia said there was need for utmost caution and high level of preparedness with regard to outbreak of water and vector-borne diseases during the current weather conditions which are marked by intermittent showers and fluctuation in temperature. The health minister has directed the civic bodies to involve 3,500 Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) in domestic breeding checking in addition to 2,500 domestic breeding checkers of the three municipal corporations engaged throughout the year. \"We have directed the medical superintendents of hospitals to ensure adequate availability of dengue testing kits for proper diagnosis,\" said Walia. He said that with the arrival of the monsoon, breeding of mosquitoes in water stagnating in the surrounding and household items like the coolers, flower vase, unclean overhead tanks is common.

This is because North America is still home to the vector which is the female anopheles mosquito, an expert said.  This means that there could be small outbreaks of malaria if somebody infected with the disease from the endemic parts of the world visits such regions, Amit Sharma of Italy&#8217;s International Centre for Genetics and Biotechnology said. \u00a0Sharma said malaria was one of the biggest killers of children in Africa.  The problem, he said, is so severe in Africa that 50 percent of children who have been afflicted with malaria and survived will have seizures while around 10 percent will have neurological problems throughout life. Unlike common perception, the disease is not limited to the tropical areas, Sharma said.  The malarial parasite has become resistant to most drugs within years of introduction. Thus the only available option is to treat the disease with multi-drug therapy, the expert added. He said that although research was on for vaccination against the disease, the best preventive method was using medicated mosquito nets. According to him, global warming was contributing directly to malaria as the parasite develops in warmer climate.  Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by plasmodium. It begins with a bite from an infected female anopheles mosquito. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever and headache, which in severe cases can progress to coma or death.

XXXXXX Locals blame 'class divide' for outbreak  The writer has posted comments on this article   NEW DELHI: The care lavished on the lawns, roads and pavements in NCERT campus seemingly does not extend to basic services, such as supply of clean drinking water. Residents say the recent outbreak of gastroenteritis here shows the lackadaisical attitude of the administration, especially towards class IV employees. The administration allegedly did not act upon repeated complaints about dirty drinking water in the Type IV block till a child died. Four-year-old Sanjana died of diarrhoea on Sunday, her family claims. Her siblings, Ayan (2) and Anjali (8), are still admitted at Safdarjung Hospital. \"My sister-in-law and father were also admitted, but they have been discharged now. My father has still not recovered,'' said Geeta, who works as an attendant at a nearby nursing home. Residents of this block, which has around 40 houses, are upset with the step-motherly treatment. \"There are other blocks in the area where water supply is good. They (director and officials) all get bottled water at home, which is why they don't care about us. We can't afford to buy clean water. Is it not their responsibility to provide clean water to residents?'' said Ved Pal, president of NCERT Employees' Committee. In the past one week, close to 110 people in this colony have complained of vomiting, severe stomach ache and diarrhoea, and some had to be admitted to hospital. Priyanka, 18, a college student, was rushed to hospital on Wednesday when she complained of severe stomach ache and low blood pressure. \"She was given medicines and doctors asked us to give her fluids,'' said Sheel Kumar, Priyanka's father. Ved Pal said his wife also fell ill after consuming contaminated water. \"In her discharge summary, doctors have written that it could be due to intake of contaminated water,'' said Pal. Another resident, Savita, said the administration is still not serious about the problem. \"The repair of water pipelines is yet to be finished,'' she said. Hemant Kumar, spokesperson, NCERT, said, \"The entire campus is getting dirty water, but these people got affected as they don't have RO systems at home or can't afford to buy mineral water. This is the reason why so many cases have been reported from this block.\"   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

India's premium Rajdhani Express, the ride from New Delhi to Sealdah was far from smooth. Not only did the passengers of B-11, an AC 3-tier coach of the train, had to bear the brunt of the sweltering heat for over five hours as the train started late following an AC failureas the air-conditioning system of the coach stopped functioning, since the train commenced its journey due to failure of the coach's air conditioning system, they were also allegedly served stale food that led to many falling ill. This isn't all, they were reportedly assaulted and threatened by RPF men when they staged a demonstration at Kanpur, the train's first halt. The passengers started complaining about the AC failure as soon as the train pulled out of the New Delhi railway station at 4:30pm on Saturday. A team of 66 persons, who had gone to attend a corporate seminar in Delhi, had booked coach number B-11. \"The AC was not working properly and it was like a furnace inside. The food that was served was stale. The yogurt had May 17 as its date of packaging and it was clearly past its expiry date. The chicken curry was almost rotten and the rotis had green fungal moulds on them. Many of us fell ill and started vomiting,\" said Sharmistha Mukherjee, one of the passengers of the coach. \"It was a harrowing experience,\" said co-passenger Barnali Kar. The passengers alleged that when they complained about the stale food to the pantry boys, the latter said they could not do anything about it. \"After some passengers fell ill, we asked for a doctor but there was no doctor around. We then complained to the coach attendant, who said that but were startled to hear him say that he was new in the job and would thus be of no help,\" added Kar. After reaching Kanpur around 9:30pm, the passengers of the coach, most of them women, got down on the platform to protest. \"Surprisingly, while we were staging a protest against the AC failure and quality of food served to us, RPF men suddenly started pushing and heckling us. No woman RPF constable was present at the spot. One of the jawans also threatened that we would be sent to jail if we continued with our protest,\" the passengers alleged. The train finally left Kanpur at 11:30pm. Passengers of other coaches also complained about the poor quality of food served to them. \"My daughter Trisha, who studies in Delhi University and was in another coach (B-3), said that she could not take the soup that was served to her. I have travelled in Rajdhani Express several times and found that the quality of food has deteriorated now,\" complained Ranjit Chatterjeee, who received his daughter at Sealdah. Among the passengers of B-11 coach were Sumita Chakraborty, wife of singer Nachiketa Chakraborty, who had reached Sealdah station to receive his wife. \"The railway authorities have increased fares, but have not improved the service. Instead, service has deteriorated. My wife told me that the woman passengers of the coach who were protesting at Kanpur railway station were heckled by RPF men there,\" said Nachiketa. As soon as the train arrived at Sealdah station one-and-a-half hours behind schedule at 11:45am on Sunday, the passengers of B-11 coach started protesting again. Two of the passengers almost collapsed after coming down on the platform. The irate passengers demanded an explanation from the railway authorities. \"A railway official apparently alleged that a group of drunk passengers had boarded the train. How can somebody sit in Kolkata and tell whether we were drunk or not?\" the passengers fumed. A complaint was lodged with the Sealdah GRP after the passengers arrived. However, divisional railway manager (Sealdah) Suchitto Kumar Das said: denied that the air-conditioning system of B-11 coach had stopped functioning or that the food served to the passengers was stale. \"The engineering staff at Kanpur checked the AC compressor and found them to be working well. The temperature inside the coach was also within the permissible limit of 22 to 25 degree Celsius. The food was also checked and nothing was found that could cause food poisoning,\" he claimed."}

This year several cases were reported in private hospitals,\" said district health officer Dr Ramachandra Bairy.\n\n \n\n The special task force of the district formed to check the spread of vector borne diseases in monsoon will continue their work till August end. The task force has several teams comprising about 1,200 anganwadi workers and 600 ASHA workers. The teams have already visited most households under the Udupi City Municipal Council limits and villages. Apart from them, nursing students are on the source reduction job in the district. They identify the breeding sources of mosquitoes and destroy them. The district health department has also distributed pamphlets to schoolchildren.\n\n \n\n Sources in the health department told TOI that all panchayat development officers (PDOs) have been asked to take action to see to it that solid waste is disposed of properly and there is no water stagnation. \"The cooperation from the citizens is also good,\" Dr Bairy said.\n\n \n\n In 2012 as many as 2,213 malaria cases and 126 dengue cases were reported in the district.\n\n"}

Normally, the seasonal fever would target the people during this period. There is no need to panic as we are taking all the effective steps,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Sensing the impending incidence of fever, Thanjavur district collector K Baskaran, a few days back, had appealed to the people to cooperate with the health officials in the 'dengue mosquito reduction measure' which is being carried out by the field staff.\n\n \n\n He also informed that the private hospitals in the district have been advised to conduct 'rapid' test to confirm the disease.

Thinking it to be acidity, I drank a syrup but the pain increased. In no time, I became giddy and was finding it difficult to walk,\" said J Muniyamma of Benson Town. Police have registered a case under Section 289 of IPC against the organizers. \"We are yet to find the real culprits. We have to seize the vessels that were used to prepare the food and payasam. It's a bailable offence,\" police said.

Doctors who attended to them confirmed that it was a case of food poisoning.   A few adults had stomach-related problems shortly after eating puliyogare (tamarind rice) and kheer, but it did not bother them much as they readily popped pills. Alarms were, however, raised when several children, who had consumed kheer, complained of stomach ache. Many of them were even vomiting. They were then rushed to a private hospital where doctors confirmed it was food poisoning. They were shifted to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in the early hours of Thursday. All the victims are from a slum on Lazar Road in Frazer Town. The food was distributed by Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) employees who had erected a Ganesha pandal at the Frazer Town branch premises.   Arathi, who lodged a complaint with the police, said she fell ill after eating the food but had not worried about it. Other grown-ups, too, had shrugged it off. &ldquo;(But) when children complained about it, we panicked and fear gripped us,&rdquo; she told Deccan Herald. Arathi, her husband Prakash and the couple&rsquo;s five-year-old daughter are among those being treated. Murugan, father of three-year-old Prema who also fell ill after eating kheer, said that his wife had fed the toddler. She had complained of stomach ache. She was stable now, he said. Dr S Rajanna, Resident Medical Officer at the hospital, confirmed that patients suffered from food poisoning. The food had been prepared several hours before consumption. When taken to the hospital, the patients complained of only vomiting and stomach ache but developed diarrhoea later. &ldquo;The adults had low blood pressure and are stable now. The condition of children has also improved,&rdquo; Rajanna told this newspaper. &ldquo;All are out of danger and there is nothing to worry about. We will keep them under observation for Thursday night before being discharged on Friday.&rdquo; Pulikeshi Nagar police have booked a case against Bescom authorities under Section 269 of the IPC for negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life. Police said that samples of the food had been collected and would be sent for forensic examination.

As per the BBMP&#039;s Health department&#039;s records, 744 cases were positive for dengue in the City since January 2013. The BBMP health officials say July, August and September are the peak months for mosquito breeding and, it is quite natural that dengue positive cases have increased in July and August. As per statistics, the BBMP recorded 13 positive cases in January, seven in February, eight in March, nine in April, 39 in May, 139 in June, and peaked in July recording 476 and 53 cases in August till date. However, no deaths have been reported.   Despite fogging and spraying being carried out by the BBMP, the numbers are only increasing, thanks to the public indifference to maintaining hygiene and cleanliness in their surroundings which is allowing mosquitoes to breed in fresh water. The Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency had the highest number of mosquito breeding places in the City, wherein of the 1,17,692 houses surveyed, 14,121 breeding places of Aedes mosquito larvae were found.&nbsp; This includes cement tanks, earthern pots, tyres and barrels. Larvae elimination   The BBMP has carried out larvicide on these containers and eliminated the larvae manually. Of the 2,89,670 houses surveyed in the City, over 31,198 places were found to have had mosquito larvae. Source reduction activities by the BBMP began only in the month of June wherein nursing students were roped in to visit households to create awareness about dengue and its causes. &nbsp; Although the BBMP and the State Health department are considering only samples tested from government laboratory as number of positive dengue cases, in reality the numbers are much more. A BBMP official said that though many private hospital have their own lab set up to test blood samples, many of them are sending the samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), the designated government laboratory.&nbsp; The official said that 60 per cent of the positive cases are from private hospitals and the remaining 40 per cent from government hospitals and health centres. * Over 500 fresh cases were reported in July and August till date * 744 cases were tested positive for dengue since January * Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency recorded the highest number of mosquito breeding places. *Of the 2,89,670 houses surveyed in the City, 31,198 were found to have had mosquito larvae   I never considered Sindhu as a contender, says coach Gopichand   Subscribe - Deccan Herald's YouTube channel   Nearly 2,000 properties to be demolished for Metro Phase II   Yeddyurappa all set to rejoin BJP   Chant these de-stress mantras!

A city hospital has witnessed one more suspected dengue death. Vijay Kumar, 17, who was referred to Bangalore Baptist Hospital from a local hospital on Thursday with high fever and low blood platelet count succumbed to his illness on Saturday night.&nbsp;  According to Bangalore Baptist Hospital authorities, Kumar was admitted to the hospital on Thursday with low blood platelets count and high fever.  Initially, he was put in the high dependency unit where he underwent blood platelet transfusion.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As his blood pressure began to drop further and he showed symptoms of breathing problems, he was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). There, he was provided symptomatic medication to maintain his blood pressure, despite which he succumbed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  A preliminary laboratory test for dengue was conducted, and the result was positive. One component of the \u2018Mac-elisa\u2019 test also yielded positive results.  One more component needs to be tested and this will be done on Monday, following which we will get a confirmation on whether or not Kumar\u2019s death was caused by dengue fever.

Nowadays, the sight of a single mosquito scares them. With over 10 people in their apartment having dengue-like symptoms, they say they have every reason to fear. &ldquo;When we last counted, there were 12 reported cases of dengue. Three of them are still recovering at the hospital,&rdquo; said Deepak, a resident. Nidhi Agarwal, who was admitted to hospital after she had high fever for three continuous days, said, &ldquo;I was admitted to a private hospital where I underwent tests. The results said that my symptoms were dengue-like. I was in the hospital for five days. I am weak and yet to recover from illness,&rdquo; she said. The worried residents say&nbsp; at least one case of dengue is reported every day. &ldquo;A week ago, there were two cases. This week, the number has reached five and as of tonight there are six confirmed dengue cases in the apartment complex,&rdquo; they said. The residents have contacted Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials, who visited the locality and conducted an inspection.   &ldquo;On our first visit, we found mosquito larvae in some of the water samples collected. Fogging was undertaken to reduce health risks,&rdquo; said Dr Kalpana, a BBMP health official who was part of the inspection team. She said that the residents should get themselves checked at government-approved hospitals. &ldquo;All hospitals which test such patients need to submit the results to the National Institute of Virology, which will confirm whether it is a positive dengue case or not and subsequently intimate us.&rdquo;She said the team had also visited a construction site nearby where there was water stagnation. &nbsp;&ldquo;We collected samples from there too and instructed the builder to keep the place clean,&rdquo; she said.  The residents allege that the builder had not taken enough precautions to ensure a hygienic environment. &ldquo;The only step the builder has taken is fogging and that is inadequate,&rdquo; a resident said. When contacted, an official from Sumadhura Constructions said, &ldquo;We have taken all necessary action.

Ten fresh cases of dengue have been reported in the last two days.   According to the BBMP&rsquo;s health department, 140 of the 285 blood samples tested since january 2013 at the National Institute of Virology, the government laboratory in Victoria Hospital, have tested positive. At the State level, there are 6,187 suspected cases. As many as 4,618 samples have been collected and 1,422 people tested positive for dengue.&nbsp; A BBMP official said the maximum number of dengue positive cases have been reported at the C V Raman Nagar and Mahadevapura areas in the City, the reason being intermittent rain coupled with lack of water supply. The official said several people store water, which provides a breeding ground to the Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes. This breed normally thrives on fresh water stored in pots, inside coconut shells or moist soil. Lack of awareness despite several drives to sensitise the public has led to the sudden increase in dengue cases, the official added. The BBMP conducted a door-to-door awareness programme from the first week of June. Officials have visited over 1,60,705 homes. The survey team has found mosquito larvae in 2,004 households. The official said extensive spraying and fogging are being carried out in the areas where positive cases have been reported. The number of workers have also been increased from three to six.

XXXXXX  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   BBMP in denial mode as Bowring reports two dengue deaths   Viral infections reach fever pitch in city   Contrary to claims by the health authorities that dengue is under control in the city, hospitals are recording a rise in the number of cases suffering from the vector-borne disease. While two dengue deaths occurred in the State-run Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital this month, most hospitals report being overwhelmed by patients with dengue symptoms.   Even as doctors confirmed that the two victims &#8212; an 11-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man &#8212; were positive dengue cases, health authorities denied any dengue deaths in the city.   The disease-causing Aedes aegypti  mosquito breeds in fresh water and bites during the day.   Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials claimed that only 140 confirmed cases had been reported this year though even a casual visit to hospitals tells a different story.  Rising numbers   While unofficial figures have not been collated, the numbers of those infected by the virus are rising, doctors in government and private hospitals confirmed to The Hindu  . &#8220;At least four persons are testing positive for dengue on a daily basis in our hospital. The problem was so severe 10 days ago we had no beds to accommodate patients,&#8221; said a doctor from K.C. General Hospital.   &#8220;Apart from the two deaths, 16 have tested positive for the disease in our hospital since June 1. We have sent the reports to the BBMP about the positive cases along with the patients&#8217; addresses,&#8221; said a senior doctor from Bowring Hospital.   In Victoria Hospital, 35 people tested positive this month.  Lab tests   But, health authorities insist only samples that test positive at the 21 sentinel laboratories designated under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme can be deemed so. Apart from the National Institute of Virology&#8217;s field station in Victoria Hospital, the Public Health Institute, National Centre for Disease Control and Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health are the three centres in the city.   BBMP Nodal Officer for National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme K. Sanghamitra said results from these labs are accurate because the samples are tested through the IgM Elisa method.   &#8220;Samples investigated through various rapid tests can show false positive results,&#8221; she said.  Fever cases   This apart, hospitals are also recording a rise in patients suffering from various viral infections and allergic respiratory disorders such as bronchial asthma, lung and upper respiratory tract infections and viral fever.   S. Rajanna, resident medical officer, Bowring Hospital, said he had seen 400 or so such cases this month.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  email:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  1.&nbsp; Comments will be moderated 2.&nbsp; Comments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.  3.&nbsp; Please write complete sentences.

Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) of Balasore Anup Ghose said unhygienic condition in the kitchen and surrounding areas might have caused food contamination.

After TOI reported use of substandard pyrethrum for vector control since 2012, Madhya Pradesh   Laghu Udyog Nigam (MPLUN) on Monday confirmed that Kolkata-based supplier Nitapol has dispatched new stock of 10,000 litres of pyrethrum. If it passes laboratory tests, fresh stock of pyrethrum could be used on the field by malaria department within days. MPLUN   had shot off letters to Nitapol to replace substandard insecticide. On August 5, the MPLUN had given three days time to the Kolkotta-based agency to comply. Madhya Pradesh has reported some three-dozen dengue deaths so far this year and the demoralized health workers have blamed vector-borne disease deaths on inferior pyrethrum supplied by Nitapol in 2012. Pyrethrum supplied failed all five tests that were carried out in a reputed New Delhi laboratory. After complaints from another supplier of the insecticide, both Central Vigilance Commission  ) and Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta are investigating the matter. The two departments--MPLUN and health department are now at loggerheads over the issue, blaming each other. A CGM of MPLUN, blaming state health department for using inferior quality pyrethrum, said, \"Why did the health department use inferior quality pyrethrum after they laboratory tests proved it was substandard.\" Asked if MPLUN would take responsibility for some 200 deaths that occurred since 2012, he said, \"Ask the health department, if MPLUN is wrong, they should hang us.\" He refused to comment on why Nitapol did not replace its substandard stock for over a year and hinted that supplied pyrethrum could have been diluted by the health department. Replying to MPLUN accusations, principal secretary health Praveer Krishn said, \"MPLUN has been complacent. Their accusations will not hold water.\" However, earlier, Krishn had claimed that the pyrethrum used by his department was not substandard. According to MPLUN officials, Nitapol has agreed to supply 10,000 litres and is being dispatched for Indore and Bhopal. However, it has requested MPLUN that it would only complete the delivery after laboratory test reports are accepted by the health department. The company was paid Rs 50.70 lakh for pyrethrum it supplied.

XXXXXX  Thursday, May 16, 2013 09:29 AM  Fear of dengue outbreak looms large  16th May 2013 08:41 AM  A sharp rise in the incidence of dengue fever in the city, especially in Kakkanad, has raised fears of an outbreak. According to sources with the Health Department, Thrikkakara has 12 confirmed cases, the highest in the district.  One of the main reason cited for this rise in cases is the water collected at construction sites in the area.  \u201cThe mosquito that transmits dengue can breed in very little water. Even water collected in an egg shell is not an exemption. When it comes to construction sites, water is stored in huge cauldrons and tanks which are usually uncovered. Besides, dengue fever is caused by mosquito bites during the day,\u201d health officials said.  They said a comprehensive and systematic campaign to prevent the spread of the fever is yet to be initiated. The officials said a woman from Kottuvallikkavu was diagnosed with dengue. \u201cBut there was no chance she could have got the disease from that place as no such case was recorded there. But she was working in a flat in Kakkanad and got infected from there,\u201d they said. \u201cThe need of the hour is a campaign under the District Collector. A team should be appointed to inspect construction sites. Occasional close scrutiny is a pre-requisite,\u201d they said.P I Muhammad Ali, Thrikkakara Municipality Chairman, said he was unaware of the issue and assured that he would look into it.  Eight cases each were registered in Elamkunnapuzha in Amballur,\u00a0 seven each in Tripunithura and Mudakuzha and four in Alangadu.  The District Medical Office informed that as many as 724 persons took treatment for fever at various hospitals on Wednesday.\u00a0 Of these, 55 persons have taken in-patient treatment. Also, 95 patients took treatment for diarrhoea.\u00a0\u00a0 The office also informed that one case of dengue was reported from Kumbalangi and two cases of rat fever were reported from Kochi Corporation.

It's suspected that a dead lizard may have poisoned the food but an official confirmation on it is awaited.   Though the condition of most of the admitted students was stated to be \"stable\", one child, Poornima Nishad, was reported to be in a serious condition. According to locals 145 children who had consumed the food were taken to the hospital for check up and 35 of them, who complained of uneasiness and nausea were admitted. The school, about 45 km from here has strength of 350 students. According to a local resident the midday meal   was served at about 12 PM and a child reportedly noticed \"a part\" of a dead lizard in the 'dal' given to him. The child reportedly informed the teacher, who instead of taking the complaint seriously, allegedly slapped the child and asked him to go back and finish his lunch. Within a few minutes of this incident, a couple of children, who had already consumed their lunch, started vomiting. A littler later other children also started complaining, leading to panic in the school. Being a village school, the news about the incident reportedly spread like wildfire and villagers arrived there and local doctors were also summoned. With the school authorities willing to take no chances, all the students were taken to the Bematra district hospital, where total chaos followed. According to a local newsman, the doctors and the nursing staff present at the hospital was totally inadequate to handle the rush of the ill students and the presence of a large number of worried parents only added to the confusion. Till 2 PM there was a total chaos and things only settled after that. Some villagers alleged that the food was served to the children without being tasted by any of the staff members. This was confirmed by Hemant Upadhyaya, District Education Officer, Bemetara, who said that the school's headmaster, Moti Lal Devangan, had been suspended for disregarding the government's explicit directions of tasting the food before serving it to the children. Devangan had reportedly signed in but had left the school before the meals were served. Upadhyaya said show cause notices have been also issued to three teachers, Anil Kunjam, Nagendra Patel and Pushpa Sahu, for being absent from the school without informing the authorities. Collector, Bemetara, B Raju, told TOI that the situation was very much under control and samples of the midday meal had been sent to the laboratory for testing. Director Health Service, Dr Kamalpreet Singh said 22 children were still in hospital and all of them were \"out of danger\". He said their condition was being monitored closely.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Raipur   Cases of Malaria likely to increase  The writer has posted comments on this article  Chhattisgarh fear a larger number of malaria   cases this year as supplies of 112 metric tons (MT) of synthetic parathyroid, a medicated spray used to kill DDT resistant female anopheles mosquitoes (carriers of the parasite), have not been received from the Centre.   The state has already witnessed five deaths this year (till May) and over 100 affected cases are reported daily in government run hospitals and medical centres. In May, even before the onset of monsoon, 3,300 cases of malaria were reported in the state but the actual number is higher as a majority of people in the interiors and tribal areas of districts like Korba, Bastar and Dantewada do not visit hospitals and still rely on witchcraft and local quacks for treatment. According to sources, the Union government had started supplying synthetic parathyroid to the state government in 2004-05 to control the breeding of a species of female anopheles mosquitoes, which is resistant to conventional insecticide, the DDT. Ever since the introduction of Synthetic Parathyroid, which is sprayed before monsoons in open areas (37MT for a population of 10 lakh people), there has been a considerable decline in the number of reported Malaria cases- from 100 per thousand people to 70 per thousand people. The Centre has, however, failed to supply the drug this year, leading to fear of a higher number of cases this year. Talking to TOI, Dr R N Netam, joint director health, Bastar division, which witnesses a large number of cases every year, said the spray of the drug is must in these areas as DDT is not totally effective. He said there had been a remarkable   decline in malaria cases in the past years and he attributed it to the spray of synthetic parathyroid and other precautionary measures like free distribution of lakhs of medicated bed nets etc. However, he maintained that the spray was essential to eradicate the DDT resistant mosquitoes .   According to Dr Jaiprakash, nodal officer for vector borne disease, the Centre had placed the order for 112 Metric Tonnes of Synthetic Parathyroid and had assured it's timely supply. He said the delay had been apparently caused at the supplier's end and the drug was expected to arrive soon. He admitted that ideally the drug has to be sprayed before the monsoons. Jaiprakash also revealed that last year the Centre had not supplied the drug but had informed the state government in time and advised them to make necessary arrangements for its local purchase. \"We had done it last year but this year we had no idea about the delay being caused,\" he said. 179 malaria deaths have occurred in the state in the past four years. According to health officials, 90 people died due to Malaria last year which was more than double the number of fatalities (42) in 2011. The death toll was reportedly 47 in 2010. The worst hit districts of the state are Raipur, Bastar and Bilaspur.

The district malaria office on Monday confirmed 117 cases of the disease this year. But a more worrying statistic is that in 19 cases, malaria has been contracted indigenously, revealing that the source of infection is within the district. \u201cIn these 19 cases, the infected people have no history of travel. Tthe infection was not imported but received from local sources within Kozhikode,\u201d sad Vimal Raj, District Malaria Officer, Kozhikode. Compared to 19 malaria cases contracted locally this year, only one case was reported to have been contracted indigenously in 2012. Official figures show there is a steep rise in the number of malaria cases in the past five months. While there was one case of malaria reported in March, 5 were detected in April, 3 in July and 10 in August this year. Of this, a majority of 10 cases have been detected within the Kozhikode Corporation, raising serious health concerns for city dwellers. Four of the 19 cases have been found in Beypore alone. The Health Department, however, says the situation is \u201cunder control\u201d. The authorities concerned blame the migrant labour population for the spread of the disease in the district. \u201cThe rise in indigenous malaria cases is due to the presence of migrant labourers from Odisha and West Bengal,\u201d said P.K. Mohanan, District Medical Officer, Kozhikode. As per news reports, Odisha has recorded the maximum number of cases of malaria in the country at 89,466 this year followed by Chhattisgarh. The District Malaria Office said besides migrant workers, whom they term as \u201chigh malaria carriers\u201d, other sources of infection include shallow wells and improperly covered overhead tanks. They said Beypore had been categorised as a \u201chigh-risk\u201d area in the district due to the large presence of migrant labourers and shallow wells. High-alert areas Other high-alert areas include Cheruvannur, Feroke, Olavanna and mostly all the areas in Kozhikode Corporation, which are poorly equipped and cash-strapped to handle a health emergency like this. \u201cWe have only bleaching powder. A knob is missing in our fogging machine. We have been trying to find a spare part, without success. All we can do is chlorination. The spread of the disease is mostly due to migrant workers in the Corporation limits,\u201d Janamma Kunjhunni, chairperson of the Corporation\u2019s Standing Committee on Health, said. But excuses apart, the Corporation does not have a Health Officer. The post has been lying vacant for the past two years. There is also a severe shortage of medical and paramedical staff at its 25 rural health centres and eight dispensaries. \u201cOur monthly expense on salary of the 700 staffers and 500 official vehicles is about Rs. 1.70 crore. The government is not providing us sufficient funds. Things have become complicated after the number of wards was increased from 55 to 75 recently,\u201d Ms. Kunjhunni said. Efforts to bring the health situation under control have begun on a war-footing after a meeting of Health officials with Additional Director, Public Health Pradeep Kumar here on Monday. \u201cWe will start a two-week anti-malaria drive in the high-risk areas of the district. Junior Health Inspectors will be deployed to visit at least 100 houses a day and collect blood samples for tests,\u201d Mr. Raj said. Mr. Raj said about Rs. 7 lakh was available from National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme for anti-malaria activities in the district."}

The squad comprising of nodal officers including the officers from health department&rsquo;s surveillance squad and the pollution control board will examine the measures taken up in taluk and village level to control vector borne diseases. The decision was taken at the Zilla Panchayat general body meeting, in response to the zilla panchayat members raising complaint over the failure of the health department to check the spread of dengue cases in Dakshina Kannada. ZP members blamed the district health department for lack of facilities for blood testing, apathy of doctors and lack of trained lab technicians in rural hospitals. Giving details about dengue cases in the district, District Health Officer O R Srirangappa confirmed one death and 92 confirmed dengue cases in the district. As on Wednesday, among those who have undergone Elisa test, 35 positive cases are reported from the government district laboratory and 57 cases are reported from private hospitals. Though there are allegations that four people have died of dengue in Dakshina Kannada, going by the government guidelines, only one death is confirmed of dengue. &ldquo;Krishnappa Naik is the only confirmed dengue death in the district and the case was confirmed based on Elisa test result. In other three cases, the patients had not undergone the test,&rdquo; he said and added that elisa test is conducted in only three centres in the district including the district government laboratory, KMC hospital and Fr Muller hospital. Explaining the measures taken by the health department to control dengue, the DHO said 10 teams comprising of ASHAs, ANMs and male health workers are making door to door visits to bring awareness about dengue and they will achieve 90 per cent of the target by June 15.&nbsp;&nbsp; MP Nalin Kumar Kateel who was at the meeting too asked the health department to press ambulances for service in rural areas on priority basis.  \"10 cr from Centre\"   ZP members who expressed discontentment over the health department&rsquo;s functioning towards controlling vector borne diseases, demanded the department officials to furnish details about the funds available to the department under NRHM and its utilisation. Providing details, RHO Dr Rukmini said the department has received Rs 10.09 crore from the central government during 2012-13. The total fund available with the department including the last year&rsquo;s balance amount is Rs 12.15 crore which was utilised under eight components including RCH, NRHM, TB, NVBDCP, IDSP etc. Of the available fund, the department&rsquo;s expenditure is put at Rs 8.68 crore and the balance is Rs 2.27 crore. When she informed that Rs 1.19 crore has been refunded to the State, the ZP members sought clarification for refunding. In reply, the RHO said that there were no takers for certain programmes like family planning and the fund meant for that component could not be diverted for other programmes, hence had to be refunded.

Health officials have identified a total of 39 suspected dengue cases as on Tuesday in the district this year and sent the blood smears for laboratory tests, which declared two cases as dengue positive. The positive cases were given medical treatment at KGH and discharged from the hospital a week ago, said district health officials. Last year, the district health officials had collected blood samples of 975 persons suspected to be suffering from dengue across the district, including 71 from GVMC limits. After blood tests, the officials declared 163 cases to be dengue positive and provided emergency medical treatment to them in a special ward at KGH. \"As on date, we have received reports of 35 suspected cases and are yet to receive the reports of four other cases, including three at Pendurthy. No deaths due to dengue have been reported so far,\" R Shyamala, District Medical and Health Officer, said during her visit to Pendurthy on Tuesday. She instructed the district health department staff to keep tabs on several vulnerable areas such as Rambilli, Achyuthapuram and Deverapalli mandals in Vizag rural and agency areas as well as in Parawada, Gajuwaka, Peda Gantyada in the city limits and take up measures like vigorous fogging to eliminate the Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes, which cause dengue. She also urged people to observe each Friday as a 'dry-day' by emptying out any water stored in containers as it is one of the best ways to check the deadly disease. Health officials advised people to wear protective clothing like long sleeved shirts and pants to prevent mosquito bites during the day."}

XXXXXX  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   GVMC identifies 20 vulnerable areas and takes steps to check the menace   The incidence of malaria in the city has shown an increase this June putting the GVMC on tenterhooks. Alarmed over the rise of cases, the corporation has identified vulnerable areas in an effort to arrest the trend.   Blood smear tests for June have shown a slide positivity rate of 5.2 per cent and 370 cases of plasmodium vivax (PV) malaria. This is higher than the 3.4 per cent SPR in June last year with 251 cases and 3 per cent SPR with 305 cases in June 2011. Alarmingly, while the rate was relatively low for 10,051 smear tests in 2011, it was much higher for 7,089 this June.   Though around the same number of tests - 7,242 - were conducted in June 2012, the incidence was low then. The increase could be attributed to migrant workers from neighbouring districts and States and hostellers who returned from their villages turning out to be carriers though they themselves might not suffer from the fever, said GVMC Health officials on Thursday. The construction workers were living in makeshift tents in unhygienic conditions exposing themselves to mosquito bite, they said. A total of 20 vulnerable areas were identified where anti-larvae operations, spraying houses in problem areas with chemicals and letting off gambusia fish in wells and sumps at construction sites was undertaken, according to Municipal Commissioner M.V. Satyanarayana. Efforts would be intensified and all medical personnel would be asked to immediately pass on any information about malaria, he added.

Authorities finally put the village, about 12 km from Mysore, on high alert on Friday. At present, 48 patients are being treated with at least 30 of them with confirmed dengue. Dengue patients have been streaming into the J S S Hospital in Mysore since May 1. According to a source in the hospital, though district health authorities were informed about the situation, nobody visited the village. The result was the death of four children. Preetham (6) was the first to die last Saturday, followed by Ravichandra (5), Yashashwini (6) and Sushmitha (18 months).\u00a0 Health authorities state that about 20 others, mostly children in the age group of 3-13 years belonging to Danagalli and Kenchalagudu, are now undergoing treatment in JSS, Cheluvamba and Vatsalya Hospitals in Mysore. Shocked villagers lashed out at the authorities. \u201cWater is being supplied to our village once in 15 days. Two borewells have gone defunct. We have been storing water and that is how the dengue spread. If authorities had bothered to care for us, four precious lives could have been saved,\u201d said Basavaraju Achari, Preetham\u2019s uncle. The situation at the hospitals was heart-rending. Jayamma, Preetham\u2019s mother, was desperate, as she barely has time to get over the shock of losing her son to the disease. Her younger daughter Priyanka is being treated for the disease. \u201cI am hoping they will be able to at least save her,\u2019\u2019 she said. Health Minister U T Khader, who visited the hospitals, expressed shock at the situation. He said the government was unaware that the situation was so serious. A temporary health care centre was opened on Friday in a government school at D Salundi and a door-to-door survey has been undertaken to identify those with symptoms of dengue. Officials have camped in the village. People with symptoms like fever, joint pain and rashes have been advised to get their blood tested and if required, referred to hospitals in Mysore. Tablets like paracetamol and amoxicillin are being administered.\u00a0 An awareness campaign was carried out in the village with posters explaining steps to be taken to control the disease. Temofos was added to the stored water to control breeding of larvae, and fogging was carried out. ASHA health workers instructed villagers to filter stored water once in three days and change the vessels to prevent breeding of larvae. District Health Officer Male Gowda said the temporary health centre will continue till the situation comes under control. Deputy Commissioner C Shikha, who\u00a0 visited the village, said steps have been taken to ensure the disease does not spread. MLA G T Deve Gowda asked officials to take steps to tide over the water crisis and open a special ward for dengue\u00a0 patients at K R Hospital.

XXXXXX  Dengue death figure fudged: report  The writer has posted comments on this article   on environment and health, compiled by an NGO, has indicated that the dengue death figure   in the state last year was fudged. It has also mentioned that the actual number affected by the mosquito-borne virus was never disclosed and would be much higher than 2033, the official figure according to the state health department website. Only 11 people succumbed to dengue in 2012, as per official records. Compiled with data collected over the last four years, mostly from government sources, the report titled \"Status of Environment Report in West Bengal\" will be released at the Kolkata Book Fair on January 26. It has collated and analysed figures on a range of areas including air quality, water, waste management, noise pollution, public health, vector borne diseases, demography, wetlands, forest and wildlife and biodiversity, with a special focus on conversion of banks, polluting ferroalloy factories in the city and violation of coastal zone regulations at Mandarmani. \"Even though the official figure of death is just 11, the situation on the ground suggests that it is much higher. Hospital records and area-wise surveys indicate that the number is at least three times more. Media reports, too, support the claim. While we have mentioned that the figure is a disputed one, it is unfortunate that the Union health ministry has accepted it,\" said environmentalist A K Ghosh, who led the study. The state health department, on the other hand, said the figure was beyond doubt. and the fact that it has been accepted by the Union health ministry was validation enough. The report is also scathing on the state of health facilities and infrastructure in the state. The state, it says, continues to suffer from inadequate infrastructure and the number of medical practitioners in government-run hospitals was inadequate. A total of 924 primary health centres (PHCs) as against the required 1993 existed in the state, a shortfall of more than 50%. Similarly, West Bengal   had a total of 349 CHCs as against a target of 498 CHCs. In the rural sector, scarcity of infrastructure and manpower continued to be critical. On the dengue outbreak of 2012, the report has been critical about the role of the state government, hinting at an effort to suppress figures. Pointing at a \"sharp increase\" in the number of cases from a total of 109 to 2033 within a span of just four weeks till September 18, 2012, it has said that the reported official death toll of 11 was \"severely contested in media reports\". \"Reports and data that we have compiled from various sources, including government ones, tell a different story. There is enough evidence to suggest that the dengue outbreak was a far more serious one than it was made out to be,\" said an official associated with the survey. It also mentions that more than 500 people have died annually due to acute encephalitis between 2008 and 2012. \"The dengue toll is 11 and there is no dispute on that. It has been ratified by the Union ministry which leaves no room for any doubt,\" said Asit Biswas, health department spokesperson.   &nbsp;&nbsp;   5 + 2 =   Newest   FEATURED TODAY IN  IC transferred over garland fiasco   Schoolboy creates kidnapping story to hide bunking   Headley sentenced to 35 years in jail for role in 26/11   Frequent Flyer   Inboxer   Networker   Sharekhaan   Well Connected   Other Times Group news sites Times Crest   &#x907;&#x915;&#x928;&#x949;&#x92e;&#x93f;&#x915; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   |   &#xa88;&#xa95;&#xacb;&#xaa8;&#xacb;&#xaae;&#xabf;&#xa95; &#xa9f;&#xabe;&#xa88;&#xaae;&#xacd;&#xab8;   Bangalore Mirror   &#x928;&#x935;&#x92d;&#x93e;&#x930;&#x924; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   &#x92e;&#x939;&#x93e;&#x930;&#x93e;&#x937;&#x94d;&#x91f;&#x94d;&#x930; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   &#xcb5;&#xcbf;&#xc9c;&#xcaf; &#xc95;&#xcb0;&#xccd;&#xca8;&#xcbe;&#xc9f;&#xc95;   Zoom   |   Ringtones   Reason for reporting:  XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Since the onset of the monsoon, nearly 300 cases have been reported, while several hundred have been labeled as \u2018suspected cases\u2019.

The children, who were all below the age of 10, had been served a meal of rice and lentils cooked at the school, Sinha said.  \"It is a matter of uncertainty why some of the children died while others survived after consuming the midday meal,\" Sinha added.  Bihar state chief minister Nitish Kumar ordered an immediate investigation into the deaths.  He said that a team of forensic experts was being rushed to the school to determine the cause of the deaths.  Television footage showed sick children lying on wooden tables in a primitive state-run hospital.  Anxious family members fanned the children in the oppressive monsoon heat.  Sinha said that the tragedy had occurred in a state-run school in the village of Masrakh, in Bihar's Saran district.  The 80 children taken ill were all transported to hospitals, Sinha said.  Some were being treated in state capital Patna.  Others were admitted to hospital in the town of Chhapra, around 65 kilometres (40 miles) from Patna.  Bihar's chief minister announced compensation to the parents of the dead children.  Free meals are offered to impoverished students in state-run schools as part of the government welfare measures in many of India's 29 states.  Bihar is considered one of India's poorest states and is also the most populous in the country.  Free lunches are hugely popular with poor families and educators see the meals as a way of increasing school attendance.  The midday meal scheme has been in place for decades.  But children often suffer from food poisoning due to poor hygiene in school kitchens and the sometimes sub-standard quality of the food.  Food prices have soared in India over the last six years, causing increased hardship for the 455 million people estimated by the World Bank to live below the poverty line.  Data from UNICEF shows that one in three malnourished children worldwide is found in India, with 47 percent of those aged below three underweight.  Earlier this month, India's cabinet passed a decree to offer subsidised grains to nearly 70 percent of the population, or more than 800 million people.

City has registered over 240 dengue positive cases till date this calendar year. This is the highest-ever in the city's history. Of these 240 positive cases, 200 have been recorded in these last two months. However, NMC maintains that these numbers do not point towards a dengue epidemic.\n\n \n\n According to NMC's data, the city registered highest-ever dengue positive cases of 231 in 2012. It was estimated that the number of cases will be high this calendar year. Accordingly, the state government had initiated steps to fight the vector-borne disease during the monsoon and post-monsoon season. As a result only 40 dengue positive cases were detected between January 1 and September 19.\n\n \n\n NMC's malaria and filaria officer Jaishree Thote told TOI that 237 positive cases have been registered as on November 19. \"If one looks into the trend, the number of cases might be over 240 till date. Only one death from dengue has been registered. We have sent many samples for testing and number is likely to cross 240,\" she said.\n\n \n\n Chairman of health consultative committee Ramesh Shingare and officiating health officer (sanitation) Dr Ashok Urkude refused to confirm the numbers and ruled out large-scale outbreak of dengue.\n\n \n\n \"This time the city received record rainfall due to which the number of cases of vector-borne diseases is expected to be high. NMC had carried out a public campaign to spread awareness among the citizens about diseases caused by vectors. Every effort has been taken to prevent the spread of dengue. Government should also do its part but NMC is getting no help. Last year government had sanctioned Rs10 lakh to carry out programmes needed to prevent spurt in dengue cases but this year we have received not a single penny,\" said Shingare.\n\n \n\n Thote added that there are many reasons for a spurt in dengue cases this year. \"NMC has been regularly collecting samples and also testing it, but the lack of cooperation on the part of the citizens it bringing all our efforts to naught. In many households air-coolers still contain water since summer. These act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. We are conducting container survey, anti-larva drive, awareness campaign in schools etc,\" she said.\n\n \n\n But the citizens blame NMC for the spread of dengue. A resident from Rathod layout, Shehbaz Siddiqui told TOI that the situation is pretty grim in the entire ward. \"Mosquitoes can be found buzzing throughout the day in all areas in Rathod layout, Palloti Nagar, Swagat Nagar, Jaffar Nagar, Gorewada etc. Three have died due to dengue-like fever in the area. Of the three, one death occurred on November 21,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Slamming NMC, Siddiqui said roads and streets are not cleaned daily. \"Filth and garbage lie strewn in many areas. Stagnant water in the open plots and Bor nullah is another cause of worry. I have not seen any NMC staffer visiting the area despite too many positive cases being registered from this ward. We have lodged a complaint with corporator Mina Tidke and officials of Mangalwari Zone but no action has been taken so far,\" he said.\n\n \n\n"}

Information about any suspected patient of vector-borne diseases should be relayed immediately to NMC,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Medical officer (sanitation) Dr Ashok Urkude said chikungunya spread in 2006 starting from Satara district. \"It takes a lot of time to spread to other cities. I have convened a meeting of all officials and staffers of health department to fix time-bound programmes. Door-to-door survey will be done, along with inspection of education institutions and corporate offices, to detect and remove mosquito-breeding sites. Few other programmes also need to be executed,\" he said.\n\n \n\n The city witnessed a small outbreak of dengue last year, which the NMC never confirmed. Some 230 persons have tests positive while three deaths were reported. Water-logging in open plots, failure to clear stored water in water coolers and other stagnant water sources are the biggest threat for spread of vector-borne diseases.\n\n"}

Weather that is cold one day and hot the next day is conducive for viruses to grow,'' said Dr Altaf Patel  . He said the last two days' weather could lead to a further spike. Winter usually sets in firmly by November-end but the city has been witnessing freakish weather; the minimum temperature has been rising and Sunday witnessed showers. Spells of flip-flopping temperatures are usually accompanied with a spike in illnesses. \"Cases of cough and cold will drastically increase in the next few days,'' said a doctor with a public hospital. Dr Patel said that flu cases have been steadily on the rise for few weeks. BMC's health report said last week that over 4,000 people were hospitalized since November for fever. Civic hospitals had admitted 400 people with malaria   and 50 with dengue in the first fortnight of November. \"We come across many cases of malaria but dengue is on the decline,'' said Dr Hozie Kapadia  , a general practitioner from Byculla. \"People move from warm exteriors to air-conditioned offices and have cold drinks. Such fluctuations make them susceptible to infection, both viral and bacterial,'' said the public hospital doctor. Dr Patel said that the elderly should be on guard against viral infection. \"In the flu season, it is best that they get themselves vaccinated,'' said the doctor. Senior citizens with heart   diseases should seek vaccinations as flu viruses sometime trigger inflammation of heart tissues, which could be fatal.

In fact, Pune has reported 681 dengue cases and six deaths till date, the highest in the state, followed by Mumbai with 484 cases and six deaths recorded till September end.\nCity-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) has tested 1,288 blood samples mainly from Pune and adjoining districts and confirmed the presence of dengue virus in 761 cases so far this year.\nThe health department blames the weather for the spurt in cases. \"The rains started early this year and it continued to drizzle even in October in some districts, creating a breeding ground for Aedes Aegypti , that causes dengue,\" said a health official.\nHowever, the dengue morbidity trend or the proportion of deaths in comparison to the number of cases has dropped this year. Last year, 71 people had died of dengue as against 54 so far this year. Of these, officials said 33 deaths have been confirmed by the state's death review committee. Of the six deaths reported in Pune, four have been confirmed as deaths due to dengue.\n\"The low fatality rate indicates better surveillance and that dengue patients are being diagnosed and treated before it is too late,\" an official said.\nThis year, several cases have been reported from rural areas as well. \"Dengue, as we know it, has always been a very urban disease. Unplanned growth and construction activities are also reasons for dengue cases in urban as well as rural areas, including small towns that are also witnessing urbanisation,\" another official said.\nWhen dengue gets complicated, it progresses to the stage of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and further to Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). The chances of cross-infection, or subsequent infections by two strains, can be the reasons behind the severity of cases.\nIn India, dengue outbreaks have been reported since the 1950s. It was labelled as an urban disease and was considered to be a self-limiting infection with fever and body ache as common symptoms. Since the late 1980s, however, the occurrence of severe dengue changed the profile of dengue.\n\"The trend continues, and today severe disease is seen in most cities that experience dengue. The case fatality rate can vary in dengue from 0.1% to 1.5%, depending on the treatment. Most of the major cities are now endemic and have annual seasonal rise in activity. For example, in Maharashtra, dengue is endemic in Mumbai, Pune, Sangli, Wai, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Jalgaon, Nagpur. An additional problem is that dengue has now spread into rural areas and claimed newer regions,\" said scientist Cecilia Dayaraj of NIV .\nControl of mosquitoes has been a long standing problem and has not been solved even by countries with better infrastructure. Officials said every house/school/office/factory or any unit for that matter, should make an effort to see there are no discarded tires, plastic bags, containers, broken plastic ware in the vicinity where water can accumulate.\n\"People should maintain their coolers, air conditioner drains, basements, elevator shafts, water storage tanks and drums mosquito free. No amount of fogging outside is going to affect the mosquitoes breeding inside the house. It is the people who have to safeguard themselves against mosquitoes,\" Dayaraj said.\n\n XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Since January this year, Karnal has seen 61 reported positive cases of dengue and 1,130 of malaria. In 2010, a total of 72 positive dengue cases were reported from the district.  This year's dengue figure is more than three times than in 2012 and CMO Vandana Bhatia said that people should also act against stagnant water which was a breeding place for mosquitoes.  She confirmed that one person died of dengue from the district and the health department was making all efforts to control the disease.  \u201cDengue is an urban phenomenon and residents help is sought by the health authorities in combating it. Our inspection drives have detected dengue malaria larvae at the upscale residential localities and some of the best schools of the city,\u201d she said.  Bhatia said that on Thursday, her team spotted larvae from waste containers stored haphazardly on the campus of Saint Theresa Convent School here.  It reflected the poor level of awareness despite intense awareness drives organised regularly for the past several years, she said.  Recently, water drain trays of refrigerators at the office of block development office (BDO) adjacent to the house of the local legislator Sumita Singh at the Nyay Puri area was found infected with mosquitoes.  The CMO said that people had misconception about the fogging and elected representatives wanted certain areas to be done for a variety of reasons which otherwise did not demand this exercise. She said fogging was only a temporary solution, the effect of which remained only for three days.  \u201cFogging is an emergency mechanism which is done in 100 houses in the vicinity of a person found suffering from malaria or dengue. But due to pressure from all quarters, our exclusive annual budget of `1.50 lakh had exhausted and today we have permission for more fogging in the district,\u201d she said.

The spread of the disease is being attributed to the failure of district administration to take timely preventive measures, including fogging operations, in the district, sources said. However, following a sharp rise in the number of cases being reported in various hospitals and health centres, besides private hospitals, the health department has now claimed to have launched an extensive exercise to contain further spread of the disease. \"Mosquitoes breed during rainy season. The peak season of malaria overlaps with rainy season. Accordingly, mosquitoes multiply in an environment conducive to breeding. As the duration of rainfall increases, so will the rate of mosquito breeding,\" a health official pointed out. Chief medical officer Vandana Bhatia said, \"Though the number of malaria cases have increased, we are working hard to contain the mosquito menace by carrying out anti-larvae operations in the district.\" The department is also looking into other possible causes behind the increase in malaria cases so that it could fight the disease more efficiently, she said. Bhatia said that the department has asked various departments and panchayat officials to ensure regular fogging operations in villages and ensure no laxity in this regard. The department had collected 64,000 blood samples, out of which, 715 were tested positive for the disease, she said.

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Kanpur   9 dengue cases in 48 hours worries health department  The writer has posted comments on this article   have been reported in the Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College in the last 48 hours, taking the total number of such cases in last fortnight to 25. Alarmed over the spurt in incidence of dengue, the district health department   has decided to launch a massive cleanliness and fogging drive in the city in collaboration with Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC).   Head of microbiology department of the GSVM, Dr Atul Garg said that six cases tested positive for dengue on Friday and three on Thursday. \"While two patients are being treated at Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital, seven are admitted to different private hospitals,\" he said. Dr Garg further said that 25 dengue patients in a fortnight was an alarming number. Apart from dengue, malaria cases too are on rise. According to the data provided by LLR doctors, around five to seven cases of malaria were being reported in the hospital on daily basis. \"The OPD charts point towards four to six malaria patients daily. There has been a spurt in such cases in the last fortnight,\" said Dr Shailendra Tiwari, chief medical superintendent of Ursula Horseman Hospital (UHM).   Commenting on the rising cases of dengue, chief medical officer (CMO), Dr RP Yadav said that according to health department data 21 dengue cases had been reported so far, including 11 from the city and the rest from nearby areas like Fatehpur and Banda. Accepting that the rise in dengue cases was a cause of alarm, he said that the department was planning a joint massive drive with KMC to tackle mosquito menace. The drive would ensure preventive measures to check spread of the disease. \"Special emphasis would be laid on densely populated areas and slums. The drive will include teams of KMC workers, heath officers and urban malaria department,\" said Dr RPO Yadav. He said that municipal commissioner had been informed about the initiative. Measures like cleanliness, fogging and anti-larval spray would be taken up by the joint team and would continue for at least a fortnight to check breeding of mosquitoes. Malaria is caused by the larva of mosquito that breeds in dirty stagnant water found in potholes or roadsides but the dengue and chikungunya are caused by Aedis egyptii mosquito that breeds is fresh water found inside homes. If this mosquito bites a person affected by dengue or chkungunya the virus enters the mosquito and when the mosquito bites a healthy person then the likelihood of this healthy person getting infected by these diseases increases. Hence there is a need to stop the breeding of Aedis egyptii mosquitoes to prevent the spread of dengue and chikungunya. It takes eight to ten days for the eggs to hatch and produce a mosquito. So there is a need for the people to completely empty the drums and other containers once a week, said the CMO and added that the drums or these containers after emptying must be completely dried and later filled with water. The water storage areas in houses like water tanks cannot be completely emptied so people should keep them covered to prevent mosquito's entry. The flower pot, cooler and trays below refrigerator must be emptied once a week. The scrap material stored on the terraces or the courtyard of a house must be removed so that the rainwater does not accumulate in them and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

At present, a mosquito in the city goes on to live as long as 32-48 days against its average life span of 14 days. \u00a0 \u201cDuring a routine check carried out on October 5 in the city, we found that there has been a control in mosquito density. But, their longevity has increased considerably,\u201d said Pravin Joshi, consultant entomologist with the World Bank project for Gujarat, adding that he and his team conduct such routine tests once a month in the city to determine the density of mosquitoes. \u00a0 Blaming it on the weather, he said that when humidity surpasses 70%, the survival rate of the mosquitoes increases proportionately. \u201cDue to low temperature and high humidity in the city, the life span of mosquitoes will also increase. Humidity leads to longevity of mosquitoes as the weather is favourable for their survival,\u201d said Joshi. With longevity, the virus inside the mosquito also regenerates, leading to more transmissions and more number of cases. \u00a0 When questioned on how the survey was carried out, he explained that his team picked up a mosquito of eight to nine days, conducted a study and made an estimate that the mosquito would survive for over 30 days. \u201cWe are witnessing more cases of chikungunya as the mosquitoes now have a longer life span. Against the average 14 days, due to the weather, the mosquitoes can survive up to 32-48 days,\u201d said Suhas Kulkarni, medical health officer of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). \u00a0 The AMC health report indicated that in the first six days of October, the city witnessed 11 cases of chikungunya and 32 cases of dengue. Similarly, last month, Amdavad reported 211 cases of chikungunya and 722 cases of dengue. \u00a0 \u201cPrefer long-sleeve clothes as dengue-breeding mosquitoes are active during the day and breed in clean water. Also, keep your surroundings clean. Also, have a good healthy diet and lots of fluids and sweets,\u201d said Dr Pragnesh Vachharajani, a physician. He also said that if one was suffering from fever, tests carried out regularly. \u201cA patient suffering from dengue should not insist on taking injections or IV fluids (glucose bottle) as an instant remedy. It can act as catastrophe and cause adverse effects,\u201d said Vachharajani.\u00a0"}

They expect that the fresh rain spell will lead to more number of cases of dengue, malaria and chikungunya - if preventive measures are not intensified. Experts fear that the mosquito-related illnesses will continue till December if anti-mosquito drives are not intensified.\n\n \n\n The numbers of mosquito-related diseases are staggering. In the last three months, the city has registered 1,065 dengue cases. The AMC claims there has been just two dengue deaths, of which only one belonged to the city. In case of malaria, there have been 6,301 cases and nearly 16 people have died, as compared to last year when 69 cases were reported between January and September. In case of falciparum, there have been 975 cases and no deaths, claim AMC officials.\n\n \n\n \"My apprehensions are that the mosquito-related illnesses would continue to peak even till December, whereas it should be on the declining trend by now. The fresh spells of rain is worrisome. Authorities should intensify the anti-malarial activities. Self treatment should be the avoided on all counts and a disease specialist should be contacted,\" says intensive care specialist Pratiba Dilip. She said the patients, who have had a previous history of dengue, should be doubly careful as a repeat dengue could prove fatal if the intervention is delayed.\n\n \n\n \"There are four serotypes of dengue virus. The body generally overreacts to any repeat attack of dengue mainly because of the immune mediators, which are chemicals messages-these messages amplify a small triggering event into a large response and it is to this that patients may become serious,\" says Dilip. Agrees infectious disease specialist Atul Patel, \"The lifelong immunity to dengue is only to one particular type of serotype of dengue virus while the patient is suspeciple to other three.\" Patel also points towards a mish mash of a variety of viral diseases during the season. \"It is important that local mosquito control measures be undertaken with urgency,\" says Patel.\n\n \n\n However, AMC health officials claim that the mosquito-related illnesses would not be worrisome if the temperature does not rise further in the coming few days - that is in between rain spells. The AMC claims that it is in the second leg of the mosquito control measures , which will end by September end.\n\n"}

After battling pot-holed roads, the AMC has now turned its attention to the deteriorating health of the city as Ahmedabad battles a surge in vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue and chikungunya. The number of chikungunya has seen a seven fold rise (587%) while dengue cases have increased by 38% compared to last year. \u00a0 Against a mere 8 cases recorded in the month of August last year, this year saw 55 cases of chikungunya. Interestingly of the 55 cases recorded in August, 43 were recorded in the last week of the month. \u00a0 As far as dengue is concerned, the number of cases increased from 278 in August 2012 to 383 in August 2013. AMC meanwhile has attributed the rise in the number of vector-borne cases to a good spell of rains intercepted by periods of dry spell.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThis year the city saw good monsoon with rains that lasted longer accompanied by dry spell. This is what has led to a surge in the cases. The transmission of the disease that began in July is likely to continue till October,\u201d said Dr SP Kulkarni, medical officer of health, AMC. \u00a0 Meanwhile, doctors in the city, who are seeing a surge of patients complaining of symptoms similar to chikungunya and dengue are advising people not to indulge in self-medication. \u00a0 On an average every family physician who is part of our association is getting at least 3 cases per day. We have around 400 family physicians in our association and you can imagine the numbers, said Dr Mehul Shelat, treasurer of the Ahmedabad Family Physicians Association.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAlthough over the last two-three days we have seen a slight decrease in cases,\u201d said Dr Shelat who advices good intake of fluids and supplements to fight the disease.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDengue and chikungunya are easy to handle individually, but the concern is about patients who are reporting both dengue-malaria or chikungunya-malaria,\u201d he said. \u00a0 Dr Pravin Garg, MD (medicine) has another piece of advice. \u201cRest and good sleep is very important when one is suffering from dengue or chikungunya apart from good intake of fluids. But what I see is that patients often ignore the symptoms and even when diagnosed with the disease continue to go to office or refuse to take rest. This only worsens the situation,\u201d said Dr Garg.\u00a0 \u00a0 He also warned against the tendency to self-medicate. \u201cWe often get patients who have popped pain-killers on their own without consulting a doctor. This can only complicate matters. It is best to consult a doctor first,\u201d the physician said.\u00a0 \u00a0 Dr Garg warns that the best defence against the disease is a strong immune system and ensuring that one gets adequate sleep and keeps oneself hydrated."}

Half-a-dozen labourers from other states employed mainly in the construction and hotel industries here were affected by various diseases in the last week, in which two malaria cases were detected in two days.  \u00a0The migrant labourers, most of them hailing from Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal, live in unhygienic conditions with poor sanitary facilities. Health officials observed that inadequate shelter, lack of basic amenities and limited access to healthcare makes them prone to vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunia and filariasis.  \u00a0According to health officials, majority of the cases reported here were due to \u2018Plasmodium vivax\u2019 infection. Female anopheles mosquitoes, infected by the malaria parasite, spread the disease. The parasite enters the bloodstream and infects the red blood cells. The symptoms of the disease include high fever, shaking chills, flu-like symptoms and anaemia.  \u00a0District Medical Officer Satheesh Kumar said that the Health Department would conduct regular screening camps for malaria among the migrant labourers in the city and suburbs. \u201cBlood samples of the labourers will be collected. Spraying and other preventive measures will be done to keep the disease from spreading,\u201d he said.  \u00a0He also said that these labourers carry the disease from their native places which in turn spreads here.  \u00a0In one of the camps here several fever cases were reported on Saturday, of which two were admitted to a private hospital here and later referred to the Medical College Hospital as their condition worsened owing to malaria. The others in the camp are also given awareness classes on the importance of hygiene.\u00a0  Muzaffarnagar riots: Arrest warrants against politicians India for expeditious implementation of G-20 decisions Modi to kickstart election campaign soon Drug-resistant bacteria are common killers Beer, music, food: Oktoberfest back in Goa Must go monsoon destinations in India More from this section City shuns holiday; &#039;Uthradapachil&#039; takes over Expert&#039;s opinion on authenticity of &#039;Indus Valley Seals&#039; sought Joint action forum of tribals to launch indefinite strike BCCI denies report of Patil telling Tendulkar to retire  Your e-mail address   All comments will be reactively moderated   Disclaimer: The views expressed in comments published on are those of the comment writers alone.

The move follows the reporting of more cases of these diseases in the district during the past few days. Health minister V S Sivakumar said a special drive against these diseases in 25 hot spots, where more cases have been reported, will be launched in the next two weeks. \"Necessary instructions have been given to strengthen fogging and source reduction activities in public places and households,'' he said. As many as 38 machines of the district health administration and 26 of the city corporation will be utilized for the fogging exercise. The services of the community medicine department of the medical college hospital will also be utilized for the dengue prevention programme in these areas. The minister has asked the district health administration officials to visit areas from where dengue deaths are being reported and take necessary steps to prevent its spread. He has also instructed them to initiate action against those creating circumstances for breeding of mosquitoes. More dengue cases have been reported from areas like Balaramapuram, Pallichal, Kalliyur, Karakulam and Vizhinjam. Besides these hot spots, steps have also been taken to check the spread of fever in 40 corporation wards, like Palayam, Peroorkada, Muttada, Thycaud, Thirumala, Vanchiyoor, Karamana, Thampanoor, Kannamoola, Vallakadavu, Kunnukuzhi and Medical College, which have been identified as high-risk areas. Primary health centres in corporation wards will coordinate the fever prevention activities. Unlike the dengue, the increase in chikungunya cases in city areas has created a concern. As many as 53 chikungunya cases were reported in the state capital in August as against around 25 till June. At least 15 dengue cases are being reported in the district a day. As per the statistics available with the directorate of health services, the total number of dengue cases reported in Thiruvananthapuram this year till June was 2,155. It had gone up to 1,071 in July while the figure was 431 in August.

Being a tourist state we also have a lot of floating population,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Govenkar said all precautionary measures, besides alerting health centers and health institutes in the state, had been taken. The national nodal officer for national vector borne disease for Goa, in Delhi has also been informed about the situation as also the measures initiated so far.\n\n \n\n Primary, urban and community health centers have been given funds ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 each, to take up measures to fight vector borne diseases. \"We have directed all health centers to take cases of fever seriously so that the virus is detected at the earliest,\" Govenkar said.\n\n \n\n To detect the dengue virus, the health department advises the MAC Eliza test which has been validated by the national vector borne disease control programme.\n\n \n\n Keeping one's surroundings clean or mosquito free is the only way to keep the dengue virus out. The health department has also been taking up advocacy workshops and awareness programmes to contain spread of dengue.\n\n"}

Six teams of the Curtorim PHC fanned out in various areas of the village and collected 300 slides for blood tests in a single day.\n\n \n\n \"We have detected 7-8 cases of fever, but the results of the blood tests will be known only by Wednesday,\" Dr Rajendra Borkar, health officer, told TOI.\n\n \n\n What prompted the health services to act was the sudden spurt in malaria cases in Aquem Baixo this month. \"From October 1 till date, 22 cases have been reported. Contrast this with the period from January to September when there has not been a single case of malaria,\" Borkar said. During the drive on Tuesday, the PHC team located several mosquito breeding sites in the village.\n\n \n\n \"We found that most people from the village have built structures besides their homes and let them out on rent for migrants to stay. These structures lack toilets and basic sanitation facilities. The waste water is discharged into the gutters and the stagnation of this water leads to breeding of mosquitoes. In the absence of toilets, migrants defecate in the open. There were several discarded tyres which serve as ideal mosquito breeding sites, and we disposed of at least 20 such tyres,\" Borkar said adding that the drive will continue for at least a week.\n\n \n\n \"The house owners have been asked to comply with the sanitation measures. The migrant workers have been told to make their health cards. Action will be taken against those failing to comply with the instructions,\" Borkar said, adding that eight persons have already been served notices.\n\n"}

At least 23 students in the south-western coastal state of Goa were treated at a hospital after they got sick at lunch, authorities said. The students, in the third to fifth grades at St. Joseph School, have been released from treatment, Vishram Borkar, a police superintendent in Goa, told CNN.   St. Joseph School is a government-aided private institution, he said.   &quot;We have registered a case of food poisoning,&quot; he told CNN, &quot;and our investigation is on.&quot;   Earlier this week, 23 students died and 25 people were hospitalized from food poisoning after a school lunch in northern India&#39;s Bihar state.   There were two cooks at the Bihar school, an official told CNN. Two children of one of them -- Panna Devi -- ate the toxic food and have died, medical superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar told CNN.   Panna Devi is not receiving treatment because she didn&#39;t eat the toxic food, Amar said. She has a third child who ate the food and is improving at a hospital, the medical chief said.   The other cook, Manju Devi, is also hospitalized, along with her three children, Amar added.   Earlier, CNN-IBN had reported that two of Manju Devi&#39;s children had died.   Bihar state is one of India&#39;s poorest. Experts have said the deaths shine a light on food safety in the country and have prompted discussion on how to improve national school food programs amid news that authorities warned of safety problems with Bihar&#39;s school meal program months ago.

Of these, 22 were discharged after being treated at the Ponda sub district hospital, while one primary student was admitted to the hospital for observation.   Ponda health officer Dr Nutan Dev said this could be a case of indigestion and not food poisoning. She said the affected children could have been hungry all morning and the food may not have been cooked properly. Dev said the exact cause of sickness would be revealed once the report of the food products is prepared. Ponda assistant district education inspector   (ADEI) Pushpa Borkar, in charge of the midday meal scheme, said, \"It cannot be a case of food poisoning. All the children were very conscious and painless when they were taken to the hospital. If it was food poisoning other students, who ate the food item could also have fallen sick.\" Food inspectors attached to the food and drug administration (FDA) collected samples of the 'pulao' and 'bhaji-pao' that were served as the midday meal for testing. The report will be ready next week. \"We have to wait for the test report which may take till Wednesday or Thursday, at it requires microbiological analysis to check and test for bacterial contamination,\" FDA director Salim Veljee said. The food was supplied by Kapileshwari-Ponda based Shivbaba self help group and Kapileshwari self help group and was served to students at around 10.30am. The school principal said students complained of stomach pain at around 11.15am, around 45 minutes later. FDA officials said that students who complained of vomiting and abdomen pain had consumed bhaji and pulao. Those who had only bhaji or only pulao did not complain. Veljee said Shivbaba SHG had supplied bhaji-pao for students from Class I to IV, whilst Kapilleshwari SHG supplied pulao for students of Classes V to VIII. Valjee said last Saturday, FDA officers had inspected both these SHG premises in the early hours of the day while preparing food and no major sanitation lapses were detected. \"There were no major lapses at Kapilleshwari SHG premises,'' Veljee said. \"It was reasonably good.\"   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

Last year 39 cases had been detected as against 53 cases this year until last month. Expressing concern over the increase in dengue cases, national vector borne disease control programme Goa in charge Dr Sachin Govenkar said the number of cases have gone up despite their efforts as dengue outbreaks have been reported from other parts of the country. \"Due to the outbreak of dengue in other parts of the country there is a high probability of the virus reaching Goa. We are worried,\" Govenkar said. Sources said people travelling with the virus may arrive in Goa, which could lead to the spread   of the virus in the state. The dengue cases detected so far are spread over a vast area of the state which rules out an outbreak. \"We have had at least one case reported from 15 different health centers,\" he added. There are 28 primary health centers in the state. While dengue if up, the only solace for the department is that the number of cases detected in June are less than the cases detected for the corresponding month last year. Last month 11 cases were reported as against 13 cases in June 2012. Govenkar said cleanliness is the only manner to keep away the dengue virus which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes. The health department has issued a circular asking government establishments and health institutes to appoint a nodal officer to ensure that their respective jurisdictions are free from vector breeding. The nodal officer will have to visit sites in the premises at least once a week to check that lids of overhead tanks are firmly shut, that there is no water leakage leading to water accumulation and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites in the premises. Goa had reported 277 dengue cases in 2009, after which the number of cases had shown a decline.

But if there are receptacles in the garbage, it may lead to water accumulation especially during the monsoon and may lead to mosquito breeding.\n\nThe high incidence of malaria has been attributed to the increase in construction activities. This has resulted in the high influx of migrant labourers from states endemic in malaria. Frequent shifting of the labour force by the contractors to different locations makes it difficult for effective screening, sources said.\n\nIn earlier years, the labour population being a high risk group that helped in transmitting malaria, was provided with long-lasting-insecticide-treated-nets (LLIN) from the funds sanctioned under the national rural health mission flexipool. But these were not provided in 2012 because funds were not sanctioned under the national rural health mission as Goa was not categorized as a \"project state\".\n\nThe increase in dengue cases happened in June 2012, which is the onset of the monsoon. The cases were reported in the villages of Satode and Veluse under the community health centre of Valpoi. A total of 38 samples were sent for testing for dengue out of which 15 were confirmed positive.\n\nThe affected areas were mostly \"kulaghars\" which have mosquito breeding sites in the form of banana leaf sheaths, coconut shells and trees with cavities."}

The hanging tyres on the sides of the barges, filled with water, are the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and this has led to some barge workers and locals contracting malaria, the note states. Cautioning against the consequences of not maintaining hygiene in the area, the note stresses, \"This will lead to serious consequences if the rate of infection goes on increasing.\" All owners, masters of barges, shipyards, drydocks, passenger launches and other fishing trawlers have been advised to prevent stagnation of water in such tyres. \"The simplest way could be to drill a hole at the bottom of the tyres so that the water drains out,\" the statement concludes.   &nbsp;&nbsp;   5 + 2 =   Newest   SPCA in limbo as chairman quits, staff contracts not renewed   2013 Class X, XII examinees will be given both marks and grades   Noida police wants DND flyway toll-free at peak hours   Justice Verma panel presents new charter of rights   Helpless India says will keep seeking David Headley's extradition   Scientists, film stars, athletes in Padma list   Frequent Flyer   Inboxer   Networker   Sharekhaan   Well Connected   Other Times Group news sites Times Crest   &#x907;&#x915;&#x928;&#x949;&#x92e;&#x93f;&#x915; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   |   &#xa88;&#xa95;&#xacb;&#xaa8;&#xacb;&#xaae;&#xabf;&#xa95; &#xa9f;&#xabe;&#xa88;&#xaae;&#xacd;&#xab8;   Bangalore Mirror   &#x928;&#x935;&#x92d;&#x93e;&#x930;&#x924; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   &#x92e;&#x939;&#x93e;&#x930;&#x93e;&#x937;&#x94d;&#x91f;&#x94d;&#x930; &#x91f;&#x93e;&#x907;&#x92e;&#x94d;&#x938;   &#xcb5;&#xcbf;&#xc9c;&#xcaf; &#xc95;&#xcb0;&#xccd;&#xca8;&#xcbe;&#xc9f;&#xc95;   Zoom   |   Ringtones   Reason for reporting:  XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Besides malaria, some cases of other vector-borne diseases were also detected, sources at the PHC said. Last year, 26 cases of malaria had been detected in the six months till June, and with the onset of the monsoon the number had shot up by 50 more by the end of June. There was a major malaria scare in 2007 in the Calangute-Candolim   belt when more than 5,000 cases of the disease had been detected. The Calangute-Candolim belt is considered one of the hotspots for the outbreak of vector-borne diseases during the monsoon due to the large number of labourers brought in from other states to work on the various construction sites in the two coastal villages living here. Health officer Dr Doreen Noronha, who recently took charge at the PHC, said that they have formed two teams of about 15 personnel each which are closely monitoring the malaria situation, with one team each in Calangute and Candolim. Team members visit construction sites, take blood samples from labourers for laboratory testing, do de-fogging wherever required, ensure that labourers have medical cards, check for stagnant pools of water and take other measures to ensure that the situation is under control.

While most were discharged after being given medical treatment, 15 have been kept under observation at the CHC   The consumption of a vegetable dish (usall) that was served to the students along with a pao (bread) that consisted the midday meal, is suspected to be the source of the food poisoning. The students were rushed to the CHC after they complained of abdominal pain and started vomiting. The students were from Classes VI and VII and some of them complained of seeing some insects in the vegetable dish served to them. \"Of the 86 students who showed symptoms of food poisoning, eight were referred to Hospicio hospital, Margao, and were later discharged. While around 25 were allowed to go home after preliminary treatment at the CHC, 15 have been kept under observation.

A Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) team rushed to Canacona and collected samples of the midday meal for laboratory analysis. Senior officials of the education department also visited the school and inquired about the incident. Powar said that the self help group that supplied the midday meal has been suspended and another one has already been appointed to supply the meals starting Friday. South Goa collector N D Agrawal also visited the CHC and the school to take stock of the situation. Speaking to TOI later, Agrawal said he would wait for the report of the FDA before taking any further action. \"There are instructions in place to all heads of high schools that a sample of the midday meal served to the students should be tasted by a teacher for its quality before it is served to the students.

XXXXXX  &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Aurangabad   Five more dengue cases reported, count climbs to 9  The writer has posted comments on this article   AURANGABAD: Five new cases of dengue were reported in the city on Tuesday, taking the total number of reported cases in Aurangabad to nine, since the onset of the monsoon. Experts say cases of viral infection have also increased by 40% since the onset of the monsoon. \"In June, 10 samples suspected of dengue were tested, of which two were found positive. In July, 30 samples were tested and seven were found to be positive,\" informed P L Gattani, medical superintendent, Government Medical College and Hospital   (GMCH), Aurangabad. The GMCH had received around 25 samples of suspected patients of dengue last week. Five of the samples were found to be positive. \"Out of these five patients, four belong to the city limits and one is from the outskirts. The city patients are from N-2 Cidco, N-7 Cidco, N-13 Bharatnagar and Kasturinagar in Harsul, while the fifth, a 10-year-old boy, is from Bajajnagar, under the Zilla Parishad limits,\" Gattani said. \"With the onset of monsoon, the rise in the humidity levels lead to a spurt in cases of dengue. The dry spell in between the rains and increase in humidity helps viruses replicate rampantly,\" said skin specialist Kishor Pathak, \"The number of patients suffering from viral fever, throat infections, skin infections and diarrhoea has gone up since June. Almost 40% of patients are suffering from monsoon-related ailments.\" \"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of dengue. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes. After virus incubation for 4-10 days, an infected mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life,\" said GMCH physician Prabhakar Jirwankar. \"A patient should be tested for dengue when a high fever (40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F) is accompanied by either two of these symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands or a rash,\" said city physician Anand Nikalje. \"Symptoms usually last for 2-7 days, after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito,\" said Nikalje. Nikalje opined that a patient's family usually gets lax with the treatment after the fever subsides. But this may lead to the platelet count dropping again and a relapse. \"Though chances of dengue proving fatal is very low, a patient can slip into a dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome if more than two types of dengue virus attack the patient one after another,\" said Nikalje. Aurangabad Municipal Corporation's acting commissioner Gokul Manore said he plans to visit the affected areas to assess the health situation in the city. Key facts:   Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection The infection causes flu-like illness and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue The global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades About half of the world's population is now at risk Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas Severe dengue is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care lowers fatality rates below 1% Dengue prevention and control solely depends on effective vector control measures Preventive measures   Primary effort should be taken to prevent Aedes from breeding Remove all sources of stagnant water Change water in vases on alternate days Remove water from flowerpot trays on alternate days Turn over all water pails and storage containers Clear blockages and put insecticides in roof gutters every month Do not litter. Rubbish such as discarded cups and water bottles can collect rainwater and help mosquitoes breed On holiday? keep these in mind:   Search   Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, libellous, slanderous or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

Since Bajajnagar in Aurangabad comes under the purview of the ZP department, the health machinery geared up to prevent the outbreak of diseases, especially ones transmitted by mosquitoes. District health officer Sudhakar Shelke was in charge of the community education camp at Bajajnagar. Key behaviour or activities that need to be addressed to prevent transmission, reduce severe disease and avoid fatalities were emphasised. \"In June, blood samples from 10 patients were tested for dengue and two were found positive. In July so far, five samples have been tested and two were found positive,\" said P L Gattani, medical superintendent, Government Medical College   and Hospital, Aurangabad. Malaria   cases are on the rise as well. According to V S Bhatkar, the Aurangabad region assistant director, malaria, the Parbhani district has seen a spurt in malaria cases between April and June. \"About 14 malaria patients have been reported in Parbhani district, four from Hingoli district, four from Jalna district and five from Aurangabad district,\" Bhatkar informed. \"The spurt during the monsoons is attributed to mosquito breeding in stagnant rainwater in discarded items strewn around residences,\" pointed out Bhatkar, \"After the first showers, vector-borne diseases spread rapidly.\" Sudhakar Shelke said that the department carries out the awareness drive annually, listing factors that lead to mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and their prevention. \"The most common practice is that of storing water in open containers or allowing rainwater to collect in discarded items, like broken buckets or mugs. A compelling tendency to disregard health department guidelines results in the rise in cases,\" Shelke said, \"Dengue occurs throughout the year in the district and monsoon sees a spurt, often in clusters where unsafe storage of water persists.

With 13 new cases of the dengue reported on Wednesday, the number of dengue cases reached to 605.\nDr Atul Garg from microbiology department of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College informed that 13 new dengue cases were diagnosed on Tuesday. The expert expressed surprise over such large number of dengue cases being reported in this part of the year.\nIt is not only the rising cases of dengue which is worrying the doctors, but the time dengue pataient are taking to recover is also an issue of concern. Hospital figures reveal that those diagnosed with the disease are not showing signs of quick recovery. While it takes around four days for the fever to subside and about a week for the weakness to ebb, several patients are still down with fever and high platelet count more than 10-12 days after admission.\nAt Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, where more than 30 patients of dengue were admitted in last fortnight, around a dozen are still under treatment. There are scores of patients who are visiting the OPD for regular check-ups and yet others who have been refused admission and are reporting daily to doctors with their reports of platelet count.\n\"The recovery period seems to be longer this time. This is probably due to the additional symptoms that we have come across this season. Most patients are complaining of a splitting headache and loose motions, which is a little unusual. It's adding to the general weakness and is delaying recovery,\" said Dr Arti Lal Chandani from medicine department of LLR.\nShe added that on an average dengue patient suffers with fever for about 3 to 4 days. Often, their platelet count takes a plunge from the sixth day onwards but it starts shooting up within next 3 to 4 days.\n\"The whole process has been delayed this time. We received cases where the platelet count started decreasing from the eighth day. We had to wait for four to six days for it to start increasing again. It would be risky to discharge such patients, especially those who have got excruciating joint pain and breathlessness, too,\" said Dr Anil Gupta , a physician. XXXXXX  Times of India"}

Dr Atul Garg from GSVM Medical College confirmed the report of 15 new dengue cases. Among the 15 new patients, 7 are from Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital while the rest cases are being treated at various private doctors of the city. The doctors, however, claimed that with the onset of winters, dengue cases will decline in the region. As per the Kanpur Municipal Corporation (KMC), extensive fogging drive launched in the month of October will also be helpful in curbing dengue. According to available statistics and reports of World Health Organisation, about 34% of dengue cases across the globe were reported in India alone. The disease is caused by an infected Aedes egypti mosquito. Malaria is caused by the larva of mosquitoes which breed in dirty stagnant water while dengue and chikungunya are spread by Aedis egyptii mosquito that breed in fresh water found inside homes. If this mosquito bites a person affected by dengue or chkungunya the virus enters the mosquito and the mosquito, when bites a healthy person, spreads the infection. Hence there was a need to stop the breeding of Aedis egyptii mosquitoes to prevent the spread of dengue and chikungunya. It takes eight to ten days for the eggs to hatch and produce a mosquito after the female aedis egyptii lays eggs in fresh water. People should empty drums and other containers used to store water, once a week and fill them after completely drying them. The water storage areas in houses like water tanks on terraces, which cannot be completely emptied and dried, should be kept closed so that the mosquitoes do not enter them. The flower pot, cooler and trays below refrigerator must be empties once a week. The scrap material stored on the terraces or courtyard of a house must be removed so that the rainwater does not accumulate in them and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Malaria is caused by the larva of mosquito which breeds in stagnant water but the dengue and chikungunya are caused by that breeds in fresh water found inside homes. If this mosquito bites a person affected by dengue or chikungunya, then the virus enters the mosquito and is further transmitted to a healthy person through this mosquito. There is a need to prevent the growth of Aedis Egyptii mosquitoes to check the spread of dengue and chikungunya. It takes eight to ten days for the eggs to hatch and produce a mosquito after the female aedis egyptii lays eggs in the fresh water. People should completely empty the drums and other containers used to store water, once a week. These containers should be completely dried before filling water in them again. The water storage areas in houses or water tanks on terraces cannot be completely emptied and dried so they should be kept closed so that mosquitoes do not enter the tanks. Flower pots, cooler and trays below refrigerator must also be emptied once a week. The scrap material stored on the terrace or the courtyard of a house must be removed so that rainwater does not accumulate there and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Before this incidence, cases were of Plasmodium Falciparum, which used to be fatal.\n\n \n\n Dr Ashok Gupta, professor and head of medical Unit-4, JK Lon Hospital, said, \u201cNow, the epidemiology of malaria is changing and the trends show that more cases of Plasmodium Vivax were reported.\u201d\n\n \n\n He said it\u2019s good news in a sense the anti-malarial medicine responds to Vivax and is easily curable with minimal cases of mortality. Whereas the medicine was not effective for Falciparum and 90% of the patients suffering from the disease was difficult to cure.\n\n \n\n While Dr BR Meena, health director, Jaipur, said, \u201cAs malaria is a fatal disease, we have made a full-year action plan. A crash programme has been started from April 1 and will go on till May 15, in which anti-larval activities and entomological survey of high areas will be done\u201d.\n\n \n\n Malaria is a disease which can be transmitted to persons of all ages. It is caused by parasites of the species plasmodium that are spread from person to person through the bites of infected mosquitoes. If not treated promptly with effective medicines, malaria can often be fatal.\n\n \n\n About 3.3 billion people \u2014 half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 are at risk of malaria. Every year, this leads to about 250 million malaria cases and nearly one million deaths."}

The largest diagnostics lab in Delhi claims that 1,354 people have tested positive for dengue in just the first 11 days of September. Three private hospitals have reported five deaths due to dengue.  But Delhi's official dengue count for 2013 (till Wednesday evening) is 520 with no deaths reported so far.  Civic agencies in Noida and Gurgaon are also underplaying the numbers.  Private hospitals in Gurgaon have run out of beds due to spike in dengue cases and put the dengue count at 310, with one death.  But official count in Gurgaon stands at only 144 dengue cases and 170 malaria cases this year.  Noida has no dengue cases, according to the official count, but private hospitals are full to capacity with big hospitals confirming 20-30 fresh cases every day.  In Delhi, of the 2,820 people who tested for dengue between September 1-11, 1,354 (48%) tested positive.  \"1,354 people tested positive for dengue in the first 11 days of September. With more people coming with fever and dengue symptoms, the numbers are likely to rise,\" said Dr Vandana Lal, executive director of Lal Path labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \"Our lab is testing between 30 and 40 persons for dengue each day, of which about 15 test positive,\" said Dr Navin Dang, director of Dr Dang's Lab.  Gurgaon has 20 hospitals with a combined strength of 5,000 beds and they are running out of beds.  \"Artemis has to turn away nearly 30 dengue patients each day. Despite adding beds, we cannot meet the demand,\" said Dr Vishal Sehgal, head of internal medicine at Artemis hospital, which has reported 125 positive cases and one death.

With over 200 patients admitted to the special dengue ward and the number rising, requirement of blood and platelet components has gone up substantially over the last few days. Every day, more than 80 units of blood and components are being administered to the patients, imposing a heavy burden on the SCBMCH\u2019s own blood bank and the Central Red Cross Blood Bank (CRCBB).  Faced with spiralling demand for blood platelets, CRCBB has started to mobilise its personnel to handle the situation. In last one week, the supply of platelet component has more than doubled from an average 20-30 a day to around 50.  The load has increased tremendously over the last few days. While three technicians have been engaged by the blood bank authorities to ensure round-the-clock operation of the component separator unit and provide platelets immediately on requisitioning, one more has been kept on stand-by.  \u201cWith limited manpower at our disposal, things will only grow more difficult if the dengue situation continues to surge,\u201d said Director Dr Benudhar Satpathy.  \u00a0The situation can be managed more effectively if some trained technicians with the SCBMCH blood bank are\u00a0 made available to us, added Dr. Satpathy.  The authorities, on their part, have also intensified blood collection drives through camps in the city and the neighbouring districts. \u201cWe have an existing stock of more than 1000 units but are conducting regular camps to maintain a healthy level to handle any emergent situation.  As many as 20 voluntary blood donation camps in association with organisations have been conducted this month alone,\u201d Satpathy said.  The blood and components are now being provided free without provision for donors to the patients. But, if the demand shoots up beyond supply level, supplying blood without donors would be difficult. \u201cRight now everything is given free. But if situation aggravates, donor exchange of blood and components will have to be implemented,\u201d said SCBMCH Emergency Officer Dr BM Moharana.  \u00a0We will have to motivate the attendants of patients to arrange donors for exchange, he added.

The Capital has so far reported over 222 cases of dengue. The civic authorities, including NDMC and MCD, have maintained that there has been no death from the disease so far, even as its domestic breeding checker has reportedly died of dengue.   Another patient, Santosh, whose death certificate is in the possession of Mail Today, has died of the killer disease.   Concern: There have a been a number of dengue cases in the past three to four days   On Saturday, a case of death of a 16-year-old from dengue was reported from West Delhi. Private hospitals have confirmed many more cases of dengue and deaths due to the disease.   A surge in the number of patients has created a problem of bed shortage in city hospitals.   \"As dengue cases are going up, we are facing a shortage of beds for the patients. Also we have our regular patients of asthma and chest infection,\" said Dr Upali Nanda, Internal Consultant at Rockland Hospital.   Sir Ganga Ram hospital has received 65 patients in its IPD and 104 patients in its OPD from April till now.   Congress calls on Akhilesh to resign as death toll in UP's communal riots passes forty   Doctors are expecting the number of cases to rise till October and then come down in November. Indraprastha Apollo Hospital is receiving eight to 10 patients every day.   \"There has been a spurt in the number of cases in the last three to four days. The situation is getting worse day by day,\" said Dr S Chatterjee, Internal Medicine department at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.   \"The mosquitoes that spread dengue usually bite at dusk and dawn but may bite at any time during the day, especially indoors, in dark areas,\" said Dr Navneet Kaur, senior consultant, internal medicine, Nova Specialty Surgery.

Government and private hospitals have reported nearly 240 cases so far, with speculation of more people falling prey to the disease. This number seems to be shockingly high, when compared to approximately 13 cases reported in 2012 and 84 in 2011.  Delhi is gearing up to control the virus, which is spread by the Aedes Aegpyti mosquito breeding in stagnant rainwater. Hospitals are also getting better equipped with an adequate quantity of intravenous fluids and saline drips, to address the needs of patients. According to reports, everyday an average of 50 patients with dengue symptoms, have been landing up at the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in central Delhi. Similar is the situation in Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in east Delhi, where 30 people have already been detected with dengue. The number of dengue patients has ascended in private hospitals as well.  Symptoms and Precautionary measures  The three types of dengue fever are- uncomplicated dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Post-monsoon, the weather becomes conducive for breeding of the Aedes mosquito. Symptoms of dengue fever usually include headache, nausea, vomiting, rashes, and pain in the eyes, joints and muscles.

Nearly 240 cases have been reported so far.\n\nThe threat of more people falling prey to the mosquito-borne dengue virus is real as rains continue in spells and stagnant rainwater provides ideal breeding conditions for the Aedes Aegyti mosquito which spreads the virus. This mosquito breeds only in fresh water.\n\n\u201cAs many as 50 patients have been landing up at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in central Delhi with symptoms of dengue each day. The number of patients has gone up over the past two weeks. At the end of September and during the first week of October, the number may rise further. To meet the situation the hospital has ordered more intravenous fluids and saline drips,\u201d Karan Vats, a doctor working in RML Hospital, told IANS.\n\nAccording to civic agencies, 240 cases of dengue have been reported across Delhi till date, which is high compared to the 13 cases reported in 2012 and 84 in 2011.\n\nGuru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in east Delhi attends to dozens of suspected dengue patients each day. At present, 30 patients who have tested positive for dengue are under treatment at this hospital.\n\n\u201cWe have 30 dengue patients admitted in the hospital. Every day, over 100 patients throng the hospital with dengue symptoms,\u201d a nodal officer dealing with dengue in GTB told IANS.\n\nThe scene is not much different at private hospitals.\n\nMoolchand Hospital in south Delhi recorded 41 confirmed cases in August alone; in the first week of September, 31 confirmed dengue cases were found at this hospital.\n\n\u201cThe number of patients has spiralled over the past two weeks. We are giving special attention to three patients who have been detected with Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS),\u201d said Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, Moolchand Hospital.\n\nThere are three types of dengue fever: the typical uncomplicated dengue fever; dengue hemorrhagic fever where the patient bleeds from the nose, gums or under the skin and which generally affects elderly people and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in which fluid leaks outside blood vessels, causing massive bleeding and shock \u2014 this form of the disease leads to multi-organ failure and is fatal.\n\n\u201cFor a patient with DSS, monitoring of blood pressure becomes crucial,\u201d Sharma said.\n\nFortis Healthcare said 20 suspected dengue cases were reported to them till August but a sudden surge in the incidence of the disease occurred in the past week with 15 cases being reported. Two of these were DSS cases.\n\n\u201cThe number of patients has gone up in the last week. We have a dedicated unit of medical staff to deal with dengue patients and any emergency cases, \u201d Vivek Nangia, director, department of pulmonology, Fortis Healthcare, told IANS.\n\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine for dengue. Doctors say those who suspect that they have contracted dengue should use pain relievers with acetaminophen and avoid those containing aspirin. They should also rest, drink plenty of fluids and consult a physician.\n\nWith the number of dengue cases increasing, NationWide \u2013 The Family Doctors, a pioneering chain of primary care clinics, has started a dengue helpline for Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR).\n\n\u201cThrough the dengue helpline 9555222570 we will clarify doubts about this infection. We believe increased awareness can lead to faster detection and contain the spread of the virus as symptoms often go unnoticed in the initial stages,\u201d said Shantanu Rahman, medical director, NationWide \u2013 The Family Doctors.\n\nDoctors say dengue fever usually starts within a week of the infection. Symptoms include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, pain in the joints and muscles, nausea and vomiting and rashes on the skin.\n\n\u201cRain brings with it high chances of dengue outbreak. Post-monsoon, the weather is conducive for breeding of the Aedes mosquito which causes dengue,\u201d a senior official of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) told IANS.\n\nThe best way to prevent dengue is to check stagnation of water.\n\nAs per the experts, the water collected in old tyres, open water containers, stagnant water in pot holes, flower pots, excess water dripping from air conditioners are possible sites for mosquito breeding. Open gutters can also serve as breeding grounds for the Aedes Aegypti.\n\n Cinema Cover Ads!\nAccording to the NVBDCP, 22,092 people were affected by dengue till August. Seventy four deaths have been caused by the disease across the country so far this year."}

Overall, 96 dengue cases have been reported this year so far. While doctors at AIIMS said they were yet to begin serological analysis of the virus this year, according to Health Minister Dr A K Walia, who took a meeting on Monday to discuss the steep rise in cases in the capital this month, NCDC experts had confirmed that the type-II strain was on the prowl this year.  But no deaths have been reported from the virus so far this year.  Till 2010, when Delhi saw over 6,000 dengue cases, and in 2011, when over 1,000 cases of dengue were reported, type-I was the most prevalent strain. Before that till 2007, maximum cases were of type-III.  The dengue virus has four known strains. Of these, the relatively milder strains are type-I, characterised by the classic dengue fever, and type-III which causes high fever without shock. The type-IV strain that causes fever with shock and type-II virus \u0097 which causes thrombocytopenia or a drop in platelet count, haemorrhagic fever, organ failure and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS) \u0097 are identified as the severe strains. Type-II has been identified as the most common cause of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), a condition that can lead to death.  Dr Walia said in surveys undertaken by national agencies, \"dense breeding\" of mosquitoes was found within the premises of several institutes, including centres of higher learning, technical and educational institutes, police stations, hospitals and government offices.

Data compiled by the three municipal corporations have revealed that 10 dengue cases have been reported in July this year compared to just 4 last year, during the same period. The malaria cases, however, have dropped to 16 in July compared to 35 during the same period last year.  \u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict whether the numbers will go up this year. If you take for instance the incidences of the last 2-3 years, the difference is marginal. We are educating people by holding public meetings to create awareness about the disease and how to prevent it,\u201d said Dr NK Yadav, municipal health officer, South Delhi Municipal Corporation.  According to the corporations, 19 dengue cases have been reported in 2013 so far, while 10 cases were reported till July last year. The malaria cases have gone down drastically with 48 cases being reported so far this year as against 115 last year during the same period.  Apollo Hospital reported five dengue and four malaria cases from July 1 to date, while Sir Ganga Ram Hospital reported 5 cases of dengue in July and 2 in August. BLK Super Speciality Hospital received 8 dengue cases over the past week.  \u201cUnlike last year, malaria is not rampant this year, but dengue and viral fever cases have gone up significantly in the past few weeks. Normally, viral fever subsides in three days but now it is taking 7-8 days to settle down,\u201d Dr R K Singhal, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital.  Meanwhile, city hospitals have also seen a rise in the number of gastritis, typhoid and jaundice cases that spreads through contaminated water. According to doctors, during this time of the year due to heavy showers, sewage water mixes with drain water leading to breeding of flies and insects. When they sit on food items, it results in food poisoning.  \u201cOver the past week, the hospital has seen 6-7 cases of gastritis each day. If the patients are dehydrated, we rehydrate them by giving ORS (oral rehydration solution). If the patient has diarrhoea or severe dehydration then they are given intravenous fluids. We prescribe antibiotics only if there is a secondary bacterial infection,\u201d said Dr Deepak Lahoti, HOD, Gastroenterology, Max Hospital, Patparganj.

Potholes on streets have resurfaced and so have a host of infection-causing viruses and bacteria.\nThe climate at present, with high levels of humidity and fluctuating temperatures, experts said, was conducive for the breeding of disease-causing mosquitoes and growth of various harmful viruses and bacteria. In the past one month, the city has seen a jump of more than 50% in the number of dengue cases.\n\nThe total number of cases reported by the health department of the unified Municipal Corporations so far this year is 14. However, there are no reports of any deaths from viral infections that have been reported from the city so far.\n\nAccording to health experts, the best way to prevent the spread of the disease is to not let water collect in and around one's house and to protect yourself from mosquito bites by using good quality mosquito repellents and wearing full-sleeved clothes.\n\nThe disease usually peaks around August and starts dying out with the onset of winters.\n\nHigh humidity and temperature variations also mean more people contracting viral influenza and conjunctivitis. Every second person is down with viral-like symptoms, which usually last for a week. The number of people visiting hospitals and clinics with symptoms of cold, cough, fever and body ache etc has seen a jump in the last few days.\n\n\"I am seeing at least 15-20 more patients, mostly children, in my outpatient department these days who show symptoms of fever, cold and cough. This is the ideal weather for virus and bacterial growth. We need to be on our guard and take preventive measures,\" said Dr Nitin Verma, senior consultant, department of paediatrics, Max Healthcare.\n\nViral infections are self-limiting, and a patient usually takes around a week to 10 days to recover completely from it. Doctors, however, warn against random and self medication and usually prescribe symptomatic treatment only.\n\n\"Not everyone requires medicines. Proper rest and a lot of fluid intake provides relief. If there is high fever, one can take paracetamol tablets. But not more than four tablets in 24 hours,\" added Dr Verma."}

Doctors say that the children are doing fine,\" said Sanjay Surjan, chairman of standing committee of East Delhi corporation  , adding that the children were discharged on Thursday. The corporation has setup a committee to look into the matter. Food samples were sent to FICCI   laboratory for testing and the report is expected within a week. But the fact that only five out of 500 school children complained and were hospitalized, has left the authorities puzzled. \"The NGO supplies food to other schools also and caters to 70,000 students in all.

As many as 126 cases were recorded in September. \"As many as 133 people tested positive for dengue in October. So far a total of 537 dengue cases have been recorded in Pune city this year. Among them, seven died due to the viral infection in this period,\" said a civic health official. The mosquito-borne infection has gripped the city since June and more cases are being reported from Warje, Hadapsar, Kothrud, Tilak Road, Karvenagar and Aundh. Residents of Dhole Patil Road, Ahmednagar Road, Sangamwadi, Bhavani Peth, Vishrambaugwada, Bibvewadi, Sahakarnagar and Dhankawdi have also been affected. The dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) is currently predominant among the three serotypes of the virus co-circulating in Pune. DENV-2 causes severe infection. The scientists at the National Institute of Virology   (NIV) identified the serotype in a molecular study of 51 blood samples of dengue-infected patients from Pune till October. Of these, DENV-2 was the causative agent in 35 cases, DENV-1 in 11 samples and DENV-3 in five samples. As far as virulence of different serotypes is considered, it is believed that DENV-2 is associated more often with dengue haemorrhagic fever that occurs in secondary infections. There were 36 confirmed cases of dengue in Pune city in June. It rose to 44 in July and 99 in August, he added. Climatic conditions favourable for breeding of mosquitoes, increased storage of water, increasing construction activity, piling of garbage  , lack of public awareness about the measures that need to be taken has aggravated the situation. Since Aedes aegypti, the mosquito which spreads dengue breeds in fresh water, it is imperative for every household to empty and clean all utensils and tanks at least once a week.

One of the five kids succumbed to dengue infection. \"Children in this age group are largely dependent on their parents for going out.

The analysis of breeding sites show that mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus have found new places to hide and breed. In the remaining 214 cases, the source of infection was outside the house.\n\n \n\n Generally, they are found in uncovered water storage barrels, flower pot plates and terrace areas. But the health workers found larvae of the aedes agypti mosquitoes in elevator ducts, lotus ponds, defrost trays in refrigerators, money plant containers and parking lots.\n\n \n\n Health officials said every household must observe one day in the week as 'dry day', when all the utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned out.\n\n \n\n \"Individuals have to keep their surroundings larvae-free.

People who have dengue fever should rest, drink plenty of fluids and reduce the fever using paracetamol or see a doctor, says the World Health Organisation. \n\n\n\n Scientists at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) have confirmed that three serotypes of dengue virus \u2014 DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 \u2014 are currently co-circulating in the city. \n\n\n\n Among the three types, DENV-3 has been predominant in the last three months.

The PMC has 188 production units of guppy fish, which eat mosquito larvae.\n\n \n\n Recently, the health department of the PMC started filing court cases against citizens and organisations who have not acted against mosquito-breeding sites on their premises despite warnings. \"Since July, we have filed 10 court cases against individuals, housing societies, scrap dealers, commercial complexes and organisations,\" Jadhav said.\n\n \n\n"}

However as a flip-side they also have to brace themselves for the inevitable--water logging, mosquitoes and invariably the outbreak of mosquito-carried diseases.\n \n \nAnd whenever that happens, the ire of the citizens against the civic authorities is for everybody to see, though those who make such complaints do not always realise that few bad habits on their parts are also responsible for the breeding of mosquitoes and the spread of mosquito-carried diseases.\n \n \nAccording to a report in the website of The Times of India, in this regard, there has been 27 dengue cases in the city so far ion the month of June. While this is an unacceptable number, the sudden spike noticed in the number of such cases has been atributed by experts to water-logging and accumulation of water in puddles, storage tanks, pits and tyres following the recent rains.  \n \n \n\"Seven cases of dengue fever were recorded in last week.

We have already initiated the surveillance activities and warned scrap dealers against dumping their scrap materials.\" \n \n \nA union health ministry team had carried out larval survey in the dengue affected areas of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad last year and pulled up both the civic bodies for failure to adequately educate citizens about health and public hyiene and how to tackle the breeding sites of aedes aegypti mosquito, the dengue vector. \n \n \nThe team's report also underlined that strict regulations need to be in place and action should be taken against storage of tyres and other scrap material, lying unattended in different areas, which collect water and provide ideal setting for mosquito breeding. \n \n \nThe team also underlined that, for effective surveillance manpower should be strengthened to tackle the acute problem - if necessary, on contractual basis (with proper training). The team also suggested that information, education and communication activities should be strengthened using different tools of mass media.\n \n \nMosquitoes are known to be the carriers of diseases like malaria and chikungunya, apart from dengue and protecting oneself from these deadly insects is of a premium, howevber you do it--with mosquito-repellant creams, coils, 'liquidators' or indeed by hiding inside mosquito nets, though what the civic  authorities of thne city can also do is to borrow a leaf out of the book of their Bangalore counterparts, who have been using a fish called the Gambusia fish, in water storage tanks to deal with the mosquito menace.\n \n \nThis unique fish species is known to be feasting on mosquito larvae and hence control the breeding of mosquitoes.\n "}

Several fresh dengue cases were detected at Noorsarai and Islampur in Nalanda district in the last 24 hours. The disease is reported to have spread its tentacles in the district as dengue positive cases were detected at the district headquarters, Biharsharif and Rajgir, in the last 48 hours. \n\n\n\n A dengue affected person identified as Hardesh Kumar, son of one Baldeo, a native of Belsar village under Noorsarai block, died at a Patna clinic on Sunday, where he was admitted a week back. \n\n\n\n On Saturday, Dhananjay Kumar, son of Suresh Painter, a resident of Dayanagar locality of Noorsarai, died at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) on Saturday. He was diagnosed dengue positive on September 14. \n\n\n\n Confirming that a Biharsharif resident had tested dengue positive at the sadar hospital, Civil Surgeon Dr Jawahar Khan said just because a dengue positive case had been detected in a particular locality, it cannot be assumed that the locality is affected by the disease. He said that sanitation work has been started at Biharsharif and Rajgir. A Biharsharif doctor said he has detected dengue positive strains in several Biharsharif patients who were referred to Patna. \n\n\n\n After the residents of Noorsarai blocked Patna-Biharsharif NH-81 for hours on Sunday to demand compensation to the kin of Dhananjay who died at PMCH on Saturday, the director-in-chief, health services, Dr Surendra Prasad and deputy director Dr Jagdish Singh visited Noorsarai and met the family members of the deceased. They also reviewed medicare facilities available in the district on Sunday evening. \n\n\n\n The civil surgeon, who accompanied them, said pits and ponds were full of drain water and filth. He said measures like fogging and bleaching would be effective only when the filth from those pits is removed. Terming the alarming situation as 'under control', he said the number of new cases has come down in the last two days. \n\n\n\n While on way to Biharsharif to attend party workers' meeting there, RJD MP Ram Kripal Yadav visited the family members of Dhananjay Kumar at their residence and said his partymen are with them. He demanded adequate compensation to the family from the government. \n\n\n\n Sources said fogging and other sanitation work were carried out at Islampur on Friday when the principal secretary, health, Depak Kumar visited the affected areas, but slowed down thereafter."}

Meanwhile, in Madurai, Corporation officials sealed six residential buildings, in which construction work was being carried out without the approval of the Town Planning Department, here on Saturday. The officials said the basement of the buildings had become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. \u201cThey found water stagnating in the basement and mosquitoes were breeding in it,\u201d Town Planning Officer M Rakkappan said.

This year, 260 dengue positive cases and two deaths were reported till August 31. This is 42 positive cases less than that last year. However, last year, there was only one death due to dengue. Dr Rajesh BV, district surveillance officer, said that with no source reduction, which is the primarily responsibility of individuals, domestic and peri-domestic breeding is rampant, especially in rural areas. The surveillance officer added that unless individuals take the responsibility of source reduction, the control of the vector borne diseases is difficult. Of the 260 cases, the highest number of dengue positive cases is reported from Bantwal at 83. This is followed by Mangalore Rural and Sullia at 47 and 46 respectively. Mangalore corporation accounts for 38, followed by Puttur at 31 and Belthangady taluk at 15. Dr Rajesh said, \"In rural areas, it is difficult to control the breeding since plantations and forest where mosquitoes get a healthy breeding ground. Even in the city, the coconut shells and empty bottles are the main source of mosquito breeding and they reappear once the awareness levels goes down. Unless the people understand the gravity of the situation, the situation will be no better,\" he said. Because of awareness programmes followed by two deaths and 100 dengue positive in 2003, cases saw a drastic reduction so much so that in the years from 2004 to 2006 there were only 11 cases and one death. The cases saw a rise in 2009 at 422 with two deaths and thereafter the dengue positive cases have always been yo-yoing above the 100 and 200 mark.

It feels like I am living my second life,\u201d said 50-year-old Sathe, who lives in a colony of 23 buildings at Goregaon, a north Mumbai suburb. This colony alone has seen more than 100 cases in the last three months. In the dengue outbreak in the city, the number of cases this year is expected to cross the 2012 figure of 1,008. Municipal and state hospitals have recorded 892 cases. Twelve people have died so far. But data from government hospitals does not reflect the extent of ailment. Most patients end up going to private hospitals, which do not report figures to the State. This October, civic authorities demanded these details. The figures they got were much higher than expected. In October alone, private hospitals treated 1,059 people for dengue. In the same period, civic hospitals received 157 patients. The figures in the private sector are higher because it starts treatment on the basis of symptoms, even before getting a laboratory report confirming dengue. Temperature variations \u201cWe started seeing a rise in dengue cases from last year. This year, there is a sudden surge in Mumbai, like there is in the rest of Maharashtra. It is because of intermittent rainfall, temperature variations and humidity,\u201d said Mangala Gomare, head of the Mumbai municipality\u2019s epidemiology cell. The municipality called experts from Delhi\u2019s National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme and the National Institute of Malarial Research from Goa this month. According to civic authorities, this disease is not limited to the \u201cpoorer areas\u201d of the city \u2014 more than 50% cases are reported from non-slum areas. In fact, doctors are seeing more cases from areas which see heavy construction activity and even from elite pockets. \u201cCases are being reported from overcrowded areas with a presence of malls, construction activity and poor drainage system,\u201d said Khusrav Bajan, consultant physician at Hinduja Hospital. \u201cThe intermittent rainfall is also leading to stagnation of water where mosquitoes thrive. Hygiene levels of the city have also dropped.\u201d However, he said, although the number of cases was relatively high this year, the intensity was lower. \u201cDengue patients are being treated in time as people are not taking fever lightly and are going to doctors.\u201d The NGO, Praja Foundation, which has been analysing dengue cases in the city for the past six years, found that one in every 28 patients died in 2008-09 and one in every 14 in 2009-10. However, the data analysed, was only of municipal and state-run hospitals. Last year, the NGO got details from the Railway, BPT, police and ESIS hospitals and found that 4,867 dengue cases were reported. Although fewer people died that year, the number of cases went up to one in 2,555. Experts believe that one cannot get the whole picture without private hospitals\u2019 data. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore private hospitals especially in health care. According to a survey we conducted, 70% of people go to private hospitals,\u201d said Praja project manager Milind Mhaske. Keywords: Mumbai Dengue outbreak"}

Workers at the contractor\u2019s firm have not been visiting the village daily, as a result of which one can see garbage and filth in almost every part. When people complain about it to the contractor, he sends his men to clean the surroundings for a day or two, then they disappear,\u2019 former corporator from the area, Eknath Tandel, said. (Read:\u00a0 Can papaya leaves help cure dengue? ) He added that the residents are angry about this, and have asked the authorities to take strict action against the contractor. \u2018Workers come frequently and spray the DDT powder besides cleaning the area, but this is not enough to control the diseases. I have personally written a letter to NMMC\u2019s health officer, Dr Ramesh Nikam, requesting him to personally look into the matter and initiate concrete steps to bring the epidemic under control,\u2019 Tandel added. Confirming that he is in the receipt of the letter, Nikam said that he has instructed the officials from his department to conduct fogging in the mornings as well as in the evening. \u2018We have also started spraying indoors since Friday and have been creating awareness among people about taking precautions to keep the disease at bay,\u2019 Nikam added. What is dengue? It is a tropical disease, usually transmitted by\u00a0 mosquitoes \u00a0and the common symptoms include\u00a0 fever , headache,\u00a0 muscle and joint pains \u00a0and skin rash. There is no vaccine for dengue and the only way to reduce infections is to improve hygiene levels so as to prevent mosquito-bites and prevent mosquitoes from breeding. It\u2019s particularly difficult to create a vaccine because it\u2019s caused by different viruses and there are no animal models available for testing.\u00a0The disease kills over five thousand Indians every year and is a seasonal\u00a0threat, particularly during the\u00a0 monsoon seasons .\u00a0 What are the symptoms of dengue? Characterized by severe flu-like symptoms, dengue affects infants, children and adults alike and could be fatal. The clinical manifestations of dengue vary with the age of the patient.\u00a0 A person suffering from high fever in the range of 40\u00b0C/ 104\u00b0F, accompanied by any two of the following symptoms could be suffering from dengue: Severe\u00a0 headache Pain behind the eyes Nausea, Vomiting Swollen glands Muscle and joint pains Rash Symptoms usually last for 2-7 days. Dengue could progress to severe dengue, a potentially fatal complication, causing leaking of plasma, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding and organ impairment. The warning signs to look out for occur 3-7 days after the first symptoms along with a decrease in temperature are: Severe abdominal pain Persistent vomiting Rapid breathing Bleeding gums Blood in vomit Fatigue, restlessness The next 24-48 hours of the critical stage can be lethal; proper medical care is needed to avoid complications and risk of death. Once you see any of the above symptoms, do visit a doctor as soon as possible. The diagnosis of dengue fever is usually made when a patient exhibits the typical clinical symptoms of headache, fever, eye pain, severe muscle aches and petechial rash. Usually if a patient is from an area that has a huge population of mosquitoes, dengue can be suspected. A blood test to diagnose people with dengue fever, called the DENV (Detect IgM Capture ELISA) may also be used. \u00a0 If untreated, the most serious complication is\u00a0dengue\u00a0haemorrhagic\u00a0fever\u00a0(DHF), in which blood vessels start to leak and cause bleeding from the nose, mouth, and gums. Untreated DHF can lead to\u00a0dengue shock syndrome\u00a0(DSS), which is lethal in 90% of cases unless promptly and correctly treated, in which case fatality rates can fall as low as 1%, depending on\u00a0quality\u00a0of treatment. Recently there have been news stories on a dengue strain that affects the liver. This condition is also called\u00a0 dengue hepatitis . It leads to severe organ malfunction and in some cases even organ failure. In the case of dengue hepatitis, fever lasts longer, often for more than a week, and leaves the patient extremely exhausted. An indication of this condition, according to experts is the sudden rise in SGOT (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase) and SGPT (Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase) levels, sometime almost 20 times higher than the normal level. Dengue hepatitis is characterized by high fever, lasting more than a week, extreme weakness. The blood tests show an increase in SGPT and SGOT levels, a drop in platelet count and WBCs. Because dengue fever is a viral infection, there is no specific treatment for the condition. The patient should seek medical advice and drink plenty of fluids. Symptomatic relief can be sought using NSAIDs (Non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs) such as Paracetamol.\u00a0 But drugs such as\u00a0 aspirin \u00a0or \u00a0ibuprofen \u00a0should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding . For severe dengue, medical care by experienced physicians can frequently save lives. It is important to maintain the fluid volume of the patient for recuperation of the patient. Dengue is a communicable diseases spread by mosquitoes from one human to another. So, the only way it can really be prevented is by avoiding mosquito bites. One can make sure all egg-laying habitats of mosquitoes like open and stagnant water source are cleaned up. If there are any open water sources you cannot eliminate, cover them and apply appropriate insecticides.\u00a0Use protection such as window screens, long-sleeved clothes, and insecticide treated materials, coils and vaporizers.\u00a0 (Read:\u00a0 Prevent dengue with these 10 practical tips ) With inputs from DNA"}

Her condition worsened on Sunday and attempts to stabilize her failed.\n\n \n\n \"After being admitted for days with dengue, her condition got worse on Sunday. Doctors at Vasudha Hospital said she required intensive care unit (ICU) support and should be moved to another hospital. We were told about this at the last moment, yet we tried to shift her to the nearest possible hospital with ICU but she passed away in transition,\" said Rajkiran Salve, a family friend of the victim.\n\n \n\n According to the BMC, 82 cases of dengue have been recorded up to October 13 whereas 437 cases of malaria have been recorded in civic hospitals. If Sangeeta's death is counted, there have been eight dengue deaths this year so far compared with five last year.\n\n \n\n Doctors are worried the trend may continue for a few more weeks. Dr Shahid Barmare, who consults with Kohinoor Hospital in Kurla, said, \"We are seeing an increase in presumptive dengue cases wherein a patient suffers from fever, severe body ache and headache. But by the time they test positive after a week or so, they are cured,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Moreover, doctors have also been seeing atypical symptoms of diseases. \"We are getting patients with severe stomach ache, fever and chills testing positive for dengue. Moreover, it is not the platelet count but white blood cells that drop,\" said Dr Khusrav Bajan, intensivist at Hinduja Hospital.\n\n"}

This is the eighth dengue death in the city since the onset of monsoon. While six deaths were reported by BMC, one was reported by Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC). Ruby Shaikh, a resident of Sakinaka, was nine months pregnant when she contracted malaria last month. \"She complained of high fever. When we admitted her in a private nursing home, she tested positive for malaria as well as dengue,\" said her brother Meezan Shaikh. According to Meezan, Ruby was transferred to JJ hospital after two days as her condition became critical. In the next 22 days, she suffered kidney failure and partial paralysis. \"Ruby lost her baby a little before she died,\" Meezan said. Meezan alleged that BMC had not carried out fumigation in Sakinaka for a long time. This year, 660 cases of dengue have been recorded by the civic health department. The BMC does not consider rapid test as the confirmatory test for dengue but several positive cases through rapid test were reported from various hospitals. According to civic health authorities, ELISA (enzyme linked immune sorbant assay) is the only confirmatory test they recognise. A significant jump in dengue was observed after the monsoon started retreating. Last week alone, 45 dengue cases were reported. \"This year, there has been an unusual rise in dengue cases. Right now, the weather is conducive for growth of dengue mosquito,\" said Dr Nandu Vijay, general physician from Bhatia hospital. In the second week of October, 2,179 cases of fever, 228 malaria cases, five leptospirosis, three H1N1, 136 gastroenteritis, 36 typhoid and 45 hepatitis cases were recorded across the city.

Most patients reside in neighbourhoods such as St Leo's Road, St Andrew's Road, and Pali Market Road. \n\n\n\n Like in Goregaon and Santacruz, several residents in Bandra needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. \n\n\n\n Anil Joseph, chairman of Perry Road Residents' Association, said: \"Several people in the area have taken ill in the last few weeks, and the majority has been diagnosed with dengue. The civic authorities have been told of the problem, but we haven't had anyone visiting the areas to screen for breeding spots.\" \n\n\n\n The street, which is home to actors Arbaaz Khan and Mallaika Arora, and Dino Morea, reported around 10 dengue cases in the last two weeks. Rajkumar Verma, a watchman from Olympia Building on St Leo's Road, was recently shifted out of the ICU at Bhabha Hospital. \n\n\n\n \"I was suffering from fever, which worsened and I collapsed. The society residents rushed me to hospital,\" he said. Doctors said Verma's platelets had fallen to 30,000 (the normal platelet count is 1,50,000 to 4,50,000 per microlitre). \n\n\n\n According to the BMC statistics, 578 dengue cases have been reported in the city this year, of which six resulted in death. The ground reality could well be very different. \n\n\n\n It was reported last month that at least 50 people residing in colonies abutting Shastri Nagar ground in Goregaon had tested positive for dengue. \n\n\n\n Similarly, five to six residents from each of the 30 buildings on the affluent Sarojini Road in Santacruz were hit by dengue or malaria. \n\n\n\n BMC, however, insisted the numbers were inaccurate, and that there was no spurt in malaria or dengue cases. \"As per our records, Bandra (W) doesn't seem to be a dengue hotbed, but we are closely monitoring all areas,\" said the civic epidemiologist, Dr Mangala Gomare. Civic officials, however, admitted that western suburbs have recorded most number of dengue cases in the city. \n\n\n\n Dr Lipeeka Parulekar from Holy Family Hospital said she and her colleagues have been handling around six dengue cases every day for the last several weeks. \"Around 20 per cent of our dengue patients needed ICU admission,\" she said. \n\n\n\n A few Bandra (W) residents also reported a dengue relapse. Malhari Hatkar, a resident of Pali Market Road, has been hospitalised since Saturday, after his platelet count dropped drastically. \n\n\n\n \"I was diagnosed with dengue last month during the Ganpati festival, and spent a week in hospital. I thought Ihad recovered completely. Last week, however, I started suffering from fever and it again turned out to be dengue,\" he said."}

Last week, 54 dengue cases were recorded in the city and 14 people tested positive for swine flu. Between September 2 and 8, BMC\u2019s epidemiology department recorded 38 dengue cases, as compared to 25 cases between August 26 and September 1. Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease consultant at Jaslok, Saifee & Kasturba hospitals, said, \u201cDengue patients are showing low white blood cell counts and low haemoglobin level.

Swine flu not alarming Doctors say that swine flu is not something to be alarmed about. \u201cPeople with co-morbid factors like diabetes, hypertension or having low immunity should take more care.

Bringing up the matter during the meeting, NCP corporator Vikram Shinde said, &ldquo;Cases of malaria and dengue are rising with every passing day, yet NMMC has no record of them. Several patients go to private hospitals and fail to inform NMMC.&rdquo;   Shinde&rsquo;s party colleague, Vaibhav Gaikwad, said, &ldquo;We have been spending lakhs on fumigation to contain malaria and dengue yet the results are not visible. So many people have been detected with malaria and dengue since the onset of monsoon. How many camps have we arranged to create awareness about malaria and dengue?&rdquo;   Shiv Sena corporator Vijayanand Mane said, &ldquo;Some people are suspected to have got dengue in Koparkhairane, and NMMC started fumigation in the areas after this came to light. The work of fumigation should be carried out regularly.   Fumigation, even when done, is not carried out in a proper manner. Even when contractor lifts garbage from the road he does not spray DDT powder, which leads to spread of diseases.&rdquo;   Standing committee chairman Suresh Kulkarni, who represents Turbhe where six deaths due to dengue have taken place, wanted to know why administration undertakes fumigation work only after deaths take place.   &ldquo;Are you waiting for the deaths to take place? I want to know what action do you plan to take against the contractor doing fumigation work in a proper manner,&rdquo; Kulkarni questioned the authorities.   Deputy municipal commissioner Aziz Shaikh, who is in-charge of the solid waste management department, admitted lapses in collection of garbage due to problems with present contractor M/S Antony Waste Handling. &ldquo;It is true that garbage is not being collected regularly due to issues with the contractor.   However, we have appointed other contractor.&rdquo;   Dr Ramesh Nikam, in-charge of health department, said, &ldquo;As soon as we found out about suspected dengue cases, we fumigated the entire area and individual households. When we got to know of deaths due to dengue in Turbhe, we immediately approached residents; while some allowed us internal fumigation, some disallowed us from entering their home.&rdquo;   He added, &ldquo;From January to second week of September this year, 274 cases of malaria and 42 cases of suspected dengue were reported. Fifteen dengue cases were confirmed.

Civic executive health officer Dr Arun Bamne also confirmed about being told about the rise in cases in S, H (east) and P (south) wards. \"We will look into it. Aggressive vector control measures are being carried out in the city,\" he said. \n\n\n\n In the last two weeks, 74 dengue cases have been reported, the figure being almost close to the August record of 87. Four patients have died so far, compared to five last year. Citizens are not only ailing from dengue. Dr Krishnakant Dhebri from Girgaum said nearly 4,000 cases of fever had been recorded in the last two weeks and 480 cases of malaria. \n\n\n\n Even though doctors have sounded alert in the spurt of dengue, the official figure shows a slight dip, from 38 two weeks ago to 36 now. The BMC figures also claim the scene is better than that last year, when 157 and 242 dengue cases were reported in August and September. \n\n\n\n But Dr Pratit Samdani, who consults in several south Mumbai hospitals, maintained dengue cases have witnessed exponential rise in the last two weeks, with a dozen of his patients currently recovering in three hospitals. On Tuesday, Samdani claimed to have treated at least nine suspected cases. \"Most hospitalized patients have tested positive in the rapid as well as the confirmatory dengue test,\" he said. \n\n\n\n While doctors vouch for the rapid (NS1 antigen) test for a timely diagnosis of dengue, authorities remain sceptical about its veracity: this could be the reason behind the discrepancy in the dengue figures available and doctors' claim. Civic officials often label cases confirmed by the rapid test as suspected ones, underplaying the incidence, say experts. This, despite the fact that the rapid test is considered accurate when conducted within second and fourth day of the ailment's onset, they add. \"This test shows that the virus is present in the body. It cannot conclude if the person will develop the disease,\" said intensivist Dr Khushrav Bhajan. The IgM antibody test, however, confirms the presence of the disease. But that did not mean the rapid test results could be discounted, experts said. \n\n\n\n Around 500 cases of malaria have also been reported in the last two weeks."}

The NMMC has spent around Rs 4 crore for mosquito eradication but is apparently falling short of expectation, feel Turbhe residents. Turbhe corporator Suresh Kulkarni said, \"Two patients from Turbhe Store have died of dengue and malaria. Turbhe residents, Vivek Gupta (27) died on September 2 and Nagnath Laxman Bhosle (35) succumbed to dengue on September 11.\" Turbhe resident Ranjit Kamble complained that mosquitoes are breeding in open gutters. \"The NMMC staff did not visit our place for fumigation or application of chemicals inside the gutter,\" he said. NMMC Malaria officer, Dr Ramesh Nikam, said, \"Anti-malaria drives are periodically carried out under the supervision of our health staff.\" Dr Nikam also denied that the three patients died of dengue or malaria. \"Four days ago, Nagnath Bhosle was admitted to a private hospital in Koparkhairane for suspected dengue. There he was found positive in NS-1 test, which we do not count. We go by the IgG and IgM antibody test. Bhosle and Kundu also died on Wednesday and the latter's death along with Gupta's demise are not related to dengue. \" Earlier, former Ghansoli corporator, Deepak Patil had alleged that two residents from Ghansoli village -Jijabai Badgujar and Rahul Yadav-had died of dengue. Dr Nikam denied these allegations, too. The NMMC, however, claimed (see box) that there has been a decline of mosquito-related diseases since last year. In 2012, from January to the first week of September,there were 51 suspected dengue cases in which 21 were found positive but the number declined in 2013 with 41 suspected cases .

The State still contributes to over one fourth of all malaria cases reported in the country though deaths have posted a marked reduction from 24.2 per cent in 2010 to 16.4 per cent in 2012. As many as 2.62 lakh malaria cases were detected in 2012 against 3.95 lakh in 2010 and 3.08 lakh in 2011.  There were 79 reported deaths in 2012 as compared to 100 deaths in 2011 and 247 in 2010. Eightyfour per cent of the deaths have been contributed by the tribal districts of Gajapati, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Keonjhar, Koraput, Malkangiri, Mayurbhanj, Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Raygada and Sundargarh, the annual\u00a0 report 2012-13 of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), which was released here on the occasion of World Malaria Day, reveals.  The sex-wise and age-wise analysis of malaria has shown that on both counts of positive cases and deaths, men outnumbered women.  Maximum deaths occurred in the age group of above 15 and most of them were males. This implies that adult males are more vulnerable due to their high exposure to the vector for occupational and other factors.  The trends, however, are looking up as Odisha was not very long ago at the top of malaria incidence and mortality in the country.  The State accounted for more than 40 per cent of malaria cases and over 50 per cent of deaths due to the disease in the country.  \u201cThe positive development can be attributed to reorientation and proper implementation of strategies for prevention and control of malaria, which have resulted in faster detection of cases and ensuring complete treatment to the afflicted,\u201d Health Minister Damodar Rout said.  The ASHA incentive guideline was modified to allow the workers to administer drugs for both falciparum and vivax malarial infections apart from their earlier responsibilities of slide collection.  More than 38,000 ASHAs, 500 forest animators, 787 Ayush doctors, 5061 health workers and 3500 tribal school teachers have been trained in providing basic diagnostic and treatment services for malaria.\u00a0  \u201cAdequate rapid diagnostic kits and the new artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) drugs have been provided up to the village level, and the ASHAs along with other field personnel are making optimal use to control malaria,\u201d Rout said.

According to official sources, around 25-30 bodies have flown into the rivers of UP in the past few days.&nbsp;   While experts and doctors warn of a serious situation as water starts receding in a few weeks, the Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB  ) has started planning to avoid the worst.   Six bodies each were recovered in the rivers in Bulandshahr and Allahabad. Besides, dead bodies were also found in Muzaffarnagar, Pilibhit and Bijnor.   &nbsp;   However, the health ministry, at the Centre, is yet to acknowledge such fears. So far, the ministry has managed to procure merely 10 lakh chlorine tablets, as desired by Uttarakhand state government.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   The tablets are yet to be delivered to the devastated state. &ldquo;We have just procured chlorine tablets for Uttarakhand and these should be delivered by Monday,&rdquo; a senior health ministry official, engaged with Emergency Medical Relief, said.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Ruling out any fear of epidemic outburst and shifting responsibilities to the state government, the official said, &ldquo;We have not received any reports of epidemic outbreak. There is no such fear and everything is under control. Right now, we are concerned about Uttarakhand and it is for the state government of UP to take care of any such fears there.&rdquo;   &nbsp;   But, reports suggested the UP government has swung into action soon after finding bodies floating through its rivers. The medical and health department of the state has sounded an alert against risk of infectious diseases in all districts of the state on Wednesday. The state is also being extra cautious as with rivers flowing above the danger mark, the risk of infectious diseases is high.   &nbsp;   Aid groups are also concerned about the risk of an epidemic. &quot;The risk of disease is high not just in Uttarakhand but certainly in other states as well where these rivers are flowing. Reports suggest that bodies are found in Allahabad and Kanpur. It is a very dangerous situation,&rdquo; says Himanshu Thakkar, a water activist with South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.   Doctors and medical practitioners also warn of outbreak of diseases such as cholera and dysentery. &ldquo;Because of water contamination, there is an increased risk of water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and jaundice.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Also, in around two to four weeks, because of stagnant water and dead bodies etc, these places are likely to witness a lot of cases of vector borne diseases such as malaria and dengue,&rdquo; says Dr Rommel Tickoo, Senior Consultant-Internal Medicines at Max Hospital. He added, there are also threats of other serious infectious diseases such as leprospyrosis which is caused from rat urine mixed in flood water etc.   Many feel the fear of epidemic outbreak will grow severe in around a month and once the rainy season gets over. &ldquo;Right now the problem is limited to Uttarakhand because the volume of water is high and the flowing speed is fast. Water has its own assimilation capacity and has a lot of useful bacteria which takes care of contamination.&nbsp;   But once the water starts receding and the volume comes down, threats of infection and epidemic may start to arrive,&rdquo; says RM Bhardwaj, Senior Scientist at CPCB. He added, the Board has started planning for that stage and will take measures to control any possible threat because of water contamination.

Truck loads of dry Deodar wood and ghee have been despatched to Kedarnath and efforts were underway to conduct mass ritual cremation of bodies strewn over the premises after their identification, post-mortem and DNA preservation formalities, a senior police official told PTI.   With the bodies already beginning to putrefy, the air is laden with a foul stench giving rise to fears of an epidemic   outbreak in affected areas.  \"Under no circumstances can we allow an outbreak of an epidemic,\" senior disaster management official K N Pandey told AFP.  \"We have reports that many stranded people are suffering from diarrhoea and other ailments and have decided to cremate the corpses near the Kedarnath shrine,\" he said.  The Union health ministry has deputed a high-level team which will review the public health measures in the state on Tuesday.  The ministry said it was monitoring the situation and has initiated a few steps for relief operations that include posting of three central public health teams in the state.  \"Eight additional teams are also kept on standby, ready to move at short notice,\" a Health Ministry statement said.  It added that district units of Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), NRHM is conducting health surveillance in all affected districts of the flood-hit state.  \"After picking up early warning signals, diarrhoea cases in Haridwar (Alwalpur), Uttarkashi (Udvi) and Rudraprayag (Chandrapuri) have been managed at incipient stage. No outbreak of water borne/food borne/air borne or direct contact diseases has been reported from affected areas,\" it said.  Besides, a specialist from National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme has been placed with the state government for providing assistance on matters pertaining to vector borne diseases and three teams have been arranged from NIMHANS, Bangalore for providing psycho-social support.  Two specialists each in cardiology, psychiatry and internal medicine have been placed with the state government.  The ministry said the state government has requested to supply specified quantity of 60 drug and non-drug items and three truckloads of such medical supplies have been delivered as an interim measure.  \"On the state's request, 10 lakh chlorine tablets are being procured by MOHFW,\" the ministry said.  The Indian Red Cross Society has provided 7 truckloads of relief material that includes tents, family packs, kitchen sets, blankets, lanterns.  The ministry said 1,100 bags for carrying bodies have been arranged through it and additional 500 bags procured by the ministry have also been sent.  The Red Cross has deployed teams from Delhi to Uttarkashi and Pittoragarh while another high-level team from the headquarters has also visited the state for assessment and coordinating relief work with state Red Cross unit.  Mass cremation delayed  Mass cremation of bodies of hundreds of people killed in floods and landslides in Uttarakhand was delayed on Tuesday, as heavy rains hampered rescue operations for the second day.  The death toll rose to 822 with 142 bodies being found, including 127 in Kedarnath, the epicentre of destruction, officials said.  With rescue operations being disrupted by cloudbursts coupled with torrential rains, IAF flew lesser sorties on Tuesday and evacuated about 500 people including 120 from Badrinath. The 500 people earlier rescued from the Himalayan shrine were safely brought from the upper reaches to Joshemath by road, a distance of 44 km.  The IAF, Army and Uttarakhand administration launched a massive operation to send logistics like firewood and fuel for conducting last rites of those killed in the worst-hit Kedarnath Valley.  State DGP Satyabrat Bansal said the DNA of unidentified bodies were being preserved and it is hoped that the weather clearns on Wednesday to facilitate the cremation.  Fresh trouble  There were also reports of fresh cloudburst in Devprayag and heavy downpour in Augustya Muni in Rudraprayag.  With rain hampering rescue operations from Badrinath where the majority of pilgrims remain stranded, chief minister Vijay Bahuguna appealed to their relatives not to run out of patience, saying they are safe with enough supplies of food and and medicines made available to them.  In Patna, Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said that he had asked the Uttarakhand government not to allow any VIP to land in the flood-ravaged areas to avoid any disturbance to relief work.  Foggy and overcast conditions in Dehradun had delayed take off by choppers at Sahasradhara helipad and Jolly Grant Airport but air rescue operations resumed with improvement in the weather.  The IAF also landed its first big helicopter in the difficult Kedarnath area and dropped material needed for the mass funeral.  \"No survivor remains in the jungles around Kedarnath. They have all been brought out,\" Ravinath Raman, nodal officer of rescue operations in Rudraprayag district, said in Guptkashi.  As rescue operations get stretched in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand, the ITBP today decided to send in a fresh contingent of its troops and bring out those tired and exhausted.  The paramilitary force, according to sources, is replacing close to 45 men with an equal strength in the areas of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Harshil and Gaurikund.  In Himachal, about 100 people including tourists and sick persons were evacuated from Sangla, Hamgo, Rekong Peo and other places in the rain-ravaged tribal district of Kinnaur by state and IAF choppers.  60 people, including some sick persons were airlifted from Sangla Valley to Rampur while nine sick people were evacuated from Hango. About a dozen people were airlifted from Rekong Peo.  Rescue operations continue  Rescuers on Tuesday evacuated 2,403 pilgrims stranded in the mountainous regions of flood-hit Uttarakhand   even as 19 persons, including IAF and paramilitary personnel, were feared killed in a chopper crash near Gaurikund.  Nearly 8,000 persons are still stranded - most of them at Harsil and Badrinath - as rescue operations continued full swing with Border Roads Organisation completing construction of a bridge at Pandukeshwar which would facilitate evacuation of those stuck at Badrinath.  Cabinet secretary Ajit Seth reviewed the rescue operations at a meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee which was attended by secretaries of 10 ministries concerned as well as senior officers of the Army, Air Force, ITBP, NDRF and BRO who have been involved in rescue efforts.  Braving inclement weather, the Indian Air Force conducted 53 sorties to air evacuate 535 persons stranded at various places in the flood-hit areas.  The IAF lost one Mi-17 V5 helicopter in a crash during the rescue operations in Gaurikund in which 19 persons, including officers of the Air Force, were feared killed.  The Army was able to evacuate through the land route 895 persons from Badrinath and 338 from Harsil areas while the Indo-Tibetan Border Police evacuated 600 persons on the land route from the Badrinath.  The National Disaster Response Force evacuated 35 persons most of whom were sadhus and porters from the Kedarnath and other areas.  BRO personnel were engaged in clearing roads landslides that have occurred in the region since yesterday.  The route from Rudraprayag to Uttarkashi has been cleared as well as the sector from Rishikesh to Srinagar and Joshimath.  \"A bridge at Pandukeshwar is almost complete. This will facilitate evacuation of those stranded in Badrinath,\" an official release said.  The Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry has despatched over 42,000 LPG cylinders to the affected areas and was ensuring enough stocks of ATF at Gauchar and Dharasu for use by the IAF for carrying out rescue   operations.  BSNL services in the state were almost normal with the restoration of most of the towers and the telephone exchanges.  Private telecom operators have been asked to expedite their work so that their services could also be restored at the earliest.  The health ministry has despatched four teams from NIMHANS to help the state government with counselling and related activities.

Two of them are in Dhanvantari Hospital's intensive care unit.  The incident at Anjuman Noor-ul-Islam school, Sakinaka, Andheri (East), will put Maharashtra on the top in ter-ms of illness cases recorded due to the mid-day meal. Maharashtra has had 557 cases over the last 10 years, followed by Delhi which has 525. This is the first time such a large number of children has been reported ill from a single school since 2003.  Following a complaint registered by the school, the Sakinaka police arrested four people including Anita Thorat, owner of the agency Parivartan Mahila Mandal that supplied the mid-day meal to the school and the bakery owner who made the cakes. According to the school staff, the cake was distributed at 10 am and students started complaining of giddiness and stomach ache within half an hour. Some started vomiting. By 11.15 am, children were rushed to four hospitals \u0097 Paramount, Apex, Dhanvantari and Sant Muktabai Hospital. Two students were sent to civic-run Rajawadi Hospital at Ghatkopar.  \"The food was served to the students of the secondary section \u0097 Classes V to VIII. As soon as we observed that the students are falling ill, our staff rushed them to hospitals immediately. We had asked few staff to stay back and inform parents. The food was supplied to us by the Mahila Bachat Gatt named Parivartan Mahila Mandal which is run by Anita Thorat. We have filed a police complaint against Thorat's agency,\" said N M Malik, Headmaster of Anjuman Noor-ul-Islam High School.  A total of 654 kids were served the cake. As many as 493 reportedly fell ill and were rushed to hospital. Thorat, who runs the Mahila Bachat Gatt, had in turn ordered the cup cakes from a Kurla-based bakery Al-Fala. She said this was not the first time she had supplied cakes to the school. When asked if she personally checks the quality of food supplied by her agency, she said, \"The quality of food supplied by us is very good and this is the first time any such incident has taken place and we too are shocked.\"   Tags:   mid-day meal illness cases   Please read our terms of use   before posting comments  TERMS OF USE: The views, opinions and comments posted are your, and are not endorsed by this website.

The list includes names of patients who were directly admitted to DMCH Ludhiana\", said district epidemiologist Dr Sailesh.  \"We have launched a house-to-house anti-larvae treatment drive in the city with special focus on affected areas.

With 12 new cases reported on Friday, the number of dengue patients in the city touched 592 mark. Describing ongoing outbreak as the worst in the last few years, doctors said that dengue cases   were from private hospitals. City doctors attributed the steady increase in dengue cases to a number of factors, including heavy rains, hectic construction activities in city and better surveillance system. There is, however, a silver lining in this grim tale. The dengue morbidity trend or the proportion of deaths in comparison to the number of cases has come down. The city reported nine unofficial deaths from dengue this year. \"This is encouraging. The low fatality rate indicates that surveillance is increasing and dengue patients are being diagnosed and treated before it is too late,\" said district epidemiologist, Deo Singh. He added that 70% dengue cases reported from the city belonged to other cities and states so the city administration could not be blamed for the surge.

In order to mitigate the risks, they follow proper hygiene and keep their surroundings clean to prevent the anopheles mosquitoes from breeding. They use impregnated bed-nets where the disease is most prevalent.\" He added that with the improvement in facilities, the disease is detected early, enabling the patient to undergo treatment on time. There is less scope for transmission, resulting in a decrease in the number of cases. \"We are carrying out fever surveillance programmes where anyone complaining of fever is advised to undergo a rapid diagnostic test. We will start spraying DDT from February next year and several awareness programmes will be carried out in malaria-affected districts,\" he added.

The number of cases reported this year is higher than last year, possibly because more cases have been detected due to improvement of medical facilities and people becoming more conscious.\" He said it is expected that the number of cases will come down by December as the aedis mosquito does not breed in the winter, but this depends on the climatic condition. \"We are sending our teams to each house in the city for source induction. The team explains to people how to maintain hygiene in order to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes,\" he added. In Kamrup (Rural), 62 cases have been detected.

Moreover, October recorded the highest number of dengue cases -- 2,442 \u2013 for the same month\u2019s reading in the past six years in the national capital. However, out of the 15 casualties, only six are confirmed dengue deaths and the rest are suspected to have been caused by the disease. Dengue, also known as \u2018breakbone fever\u2019 because of excruciating joint pain and pounding headaches, is caused by the female aedes mosquito. The disease has no vaccine or specific treatment and a severe form of dengue often turns fatal. Symptoms of dengue include severe headache, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, muscle and joint pains and rashes while in severe cases the symptoms could be severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums and blood in vomit. According to experts, death from dengue occurs due to internal bleeding, shock and organ failure. According to government data, the disease kills over five thousand Indians every year, particularly during the monsoons. Faced with the large number of dengue cases this year, the authorities even launched a massive awareness drive through TV, radio and newspaper advertisements besides carrying out fogging drives across the city. Official figures, however, show a decline in the number of dengue cases over the past few weeks. \u201cEvery year the virulence of the virus is different and it was stronger this year. This could have led to more deaths,\u201d said Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant internal medicine, Max Hospital, Saket. With 105 recent cases in the past four days alone, the total number of dengue cases in the city has gone up to 4,671 which is just 1,588 short of the record figure of 6,259 cases recorded in 2010, the year of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. According to corporation data, North Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) recorded the highest number of cases with 1,958, followed by South DMC (1,373) and East DMC (1,163). According to doctors, the dengue virus type II causes more complicated disease and leads to more deaths. \u201cHowever, even educated people are not aware about the cause of the disease. People think that every dengue case is life-threatening. In fact, it is not only about the platelet count, a person may get affected by dengue even if he/she is dehydrated,\u201d Dr Tickoo added. Dr S P Byotra, head of the department of medicine in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital pointed out that, \u201cif a person had been affected by the disease once, he could get affected by it again. And when the person is affected the second time, the severity of the disease could be more.\u201d YS Mann, spokesperson, North DMC said that from more than 100 cases on an average per day, the number of dengue cases have come down to around 100 cases in 4-5 days. \u201cThis is a positive indication. The number of cases will go down further gradually and will peter out eventually,\u201d he added."}

In India, many savour the moment when the skies turn grey and monsoon rains lash down to bring respite from the excruciating summer heat. This year, the country saw the heaviest rains in nearly two decades, particularly pleasing farmers who rely on the monsoon for their living. But the rains also bring challenges, including the appearance of Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that spreads dengue and yellow fever. The government says 109 Indians have died from the tropical illness in the first nine months of this year and 38,179 cases have been recorded in total, more than double the number for all of 2011. Experts say this year's early and prolonged monsoon has provided more breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes, who lay their eggs in stagnant water, including pots of clean water, puddles and open sewage drains. 'Shortage of beds' Dengue cases usually jump during and just after the rainy season, which normally lasts from June to September, but this year it has extended until October in some Indian states. Hospitals and clinics across the country have been inundated with patients, putting a strain on emergency services, while many schools have shut as a precautionary measure. \"There has been a shortage of beds,\" said Dr Sanjay K Tandon, medical superintendent at Paras Spring Meadows Hospital, a private facility in the capital, Delhi. \"We have refused patients. If the critical phase for a patient is over, we explain to them that now you don't need admission, so let the other person get the advantage.\" Image caption Nearly 3,000 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi Meanwhile, at Delhi's largest state-run hospital, routine surgeries were halted last week following a government order so that equipment and staff could attend to the daily rush of patients coming in for the past few weeks to be tested for the virus. \"Routine, planned surgeries have been deferred temporarily. But emergency operations, those that absolutely must happen, are still being done,\" said Dr RB Mittal, medical superintendent of Hindu Rao Hospital. The areas worst affected in India have been the southern state of Kerala - where more than 23 people have died and 7,000 people are infected - and the western state of Maharashtra - which has registered 31 deaths and 2,681 infections. The World Health Organisation says about half of the globe's population is now at risk from the infection and a study published in April in the scientific journal Nature found India had more cases of dengue than any other country in the world. All hospitals and clinics in India are meant to report every case of confirmed dengue, but many don't, with some health experts believing there isn't enough oversight. DENGUE FEVER Dengue fever is prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions including South East Asia and South America It is a major cause of illness worldwide, causing about 100 million episodes of feverish illness a year Symptoms include high fever, aching joints and vomiting Complications can prove fatal in extreme cases There are four major strains of the virus In Delhi, the official number of reported cases is 3,298. But Dr Navin Dang, who runs a medical diagnostics centre, said the real number could be 10 times higher. \"We have been testing for 50 to 60 patients every day over the past month and a half, and getting 20 to 25 positive results a day, so as a standalone lab, we have reported over 1,000 dengue patients,\" he said. \"The government numbers are totally underreported... to a very substantial extent. The government only picks up data from a few hospitals and labs.\" Dr AC Dhariwal, director of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, a government agency, admitted it was \"very, very difficult to get accurate numbers\". Gareth Camilo Sims, a Welsh expatriate living in Delhi, was recently diagnosed with dengue fever, also called \"breakbone disease,\" after suffering from a headache, exhaustion, high temperature and body rashes - clear signs he had contracted the virus despite taking preventive steps. \"I was really careful,\" the 31-year-old lawyer said. \"I put mosquito repellent on a few times a day and I haven't been bitten many times,\" he added. His blood platelet count didn't drop to dangerous levels, but when it does, it can be deadly. There is no treatment for the virus. Image caption Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes Mr Sims said he was advised to keep hydrated by drinking six litres of water each day, take a paracetamol pill every six hours and occasionally apply a cold flannel to his forehead to reduce fever. Mr Dhariwal says surveillance is being carried out across the country and in hotspot areas, extensive education campaigns are being organised to inform the public of risks. \"Dengue enters a country and it stays there,\" he added. But some have blamed the government for not doing enough to tackle the spread of the disease despite fresh cases being reported year after year. \"It's a combined responsibility for everybody,\" Dr Dang said. \"But of course the government as the elected representative has to play a significant role. \"If proper measures are taken, there's no stagnant water, there's proper fumigation, sewage and drainpipes are cleaned properly, there is no water logging, and there are fish in water bodies, I'm quite sure things can be brought under control,\" he says."}

Dr Atul Gogia, consultant in medicine at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said, \"I have seen four patients who have tested positive for dengue and malaria. Their symptoms are of dengue, but diagnostic reports also show malaria parasite.\" Doctors said most of these patients have been diagnosed with the less virulent vivax strain of malaria. \"Only one patient had falciparum malaria, also known as cerebral malaria. He had symptoms of multi-organ failure, but we managed to control it and he survived,\" he said. Dr S Chatterjee, consultant in internal medicine at Apollo Hospitals, said, \"We are seeing quite a few cases of patients with dengue and malaria together. When fever persists in a patient, we conduct a malaria test as a precautionary measure.\" While both are vector-borne diseases, dengue is a viral disease and malaria is caused by a parasite. The mosquitoes which carry the diseases are different \u0097 the Aedes aegypti causes dengue, while the female Anopheles causes malaria. \"The causative organism for both are different and they are spread by different vectors, so technically a person can get both the diseases together. We need more fogging activities to control mosquitoes,\" a microbiologist from AIIMS said. A doctor at Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in East Delhisaid at least 7-8 such cases have been seen over the past two weeks. Lok Nayak hospital doctors said at least 4-5 cases were reported there. According to civic bodies, 2,557 dengue cases have been reported this year, with three confirmed and seven suspected deaths. Nearly 120 cases of malaria have been reported, but no deaths. Civic officials said no count is maintained for patients who get both diseases at the same time. \"There are no guidelines for a separate count of such patients. The same patient may be counted twice if they are diagnosed with both diseases,\" a municipal health official said.

Acquiring platelets has become a daunting task,\" Dr B D Athani, medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, said.

Why can't they take preventive measures?\" Dr Dang said.\n\n \n\n A senior municipal official said that the dengue situation in Delhi cannot be termed an epidemic because it is being witnessed all over the country. \"Dengue spread in post-monsoon season is expected. It goes up after every three or four years which could be the reason for the high incidence this time,\" the official said.

Nearly 150 people are ill in the area in various residential localities. Water contamination that took place about 10 days ago is believed to be the reason for the outbreak. Residents of the area had complained regarding this to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials. According to VMC officials, 61 cases of jaundice and 88 cases of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis have been detected in the area during the last three days. The localities that have been affected are located between Chanakyapuri crossroads and Narmada branch canal located ahead. VMC teams have been conducting door-to-door surveys in the affected parts and have so far covered over 3,200 houses. VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said extensive screening of the residents had been done and they had been given chlorine tablets to purify water and oral rehydration solution packets. He added that the water samples collected now were uncontaminated. Sources said that work on a pipeline was conducted in the area about 10 days ago. Even as this was being done there were heavy rains while the pipeline was still open and this may have contaminated water. Residents had complained of dirty water supply around the same time.

While around 140 patients had shown dengue symptoms this year, only 31 patients tested positive for the vector-borne disease. The toll for positive cases stood at 115 last year, while around 350 cases with dengue symptoms had been reported. \"The drop in the number of dengue cases is highly significant. From last year's 115 the number has dropped to 31 which is great news,\" said Dr Anil Ailawadhi, District Malaria Officer (DMO). The first case of dengue was reported in the last week of August this year. Meanwhile, the threat posed by the disease is expected to end by mid-November. \"With the fall in temperature, the spread of the disease reduces. Dengue mosquitoes die below 25 degrees temperature. This year the fall in temperature, especially night temperature, arrived early which helps in limiting the spread of the disease,\" informed an official from the Malaria department. Owing to the high number of cases reported last year, the department had started early intervention to stop the disease from spreading. As many as 10 breeder checkers, workers who make house-to-house visit to identify dengue breeding sites, were especially recruited for slum dwellings in the urban area of the district this year. Last year, maximum cases were reported from areas like Buddhanpur, Indira colony, Devinagar and other such areas in Panchkula (Urban). \"Though more cases of dengue can be reported in the next few days, the stretch of the dengue period will end earlier compared to the previous year,\" the DMO said. Last year, the disease had cast its spell till the end of November.

According to officials, after 12 cases of dengue were detected in the last 15 days at the government hospital in Sector 6, strict guidelines have been issued to doctors that tests should be carried out regularly in all cases where people show even mild symptoms of the disease.  Senior Medical Officer at the Sector 6 hospital, Dr Sanjeev Trehan, said, \"Of the 100 patients we checked at the hospital in the last 15 days, some 12 people were tested positive for dengue.\"  He said that dengue-like symptoms were reported among 87 people, but later the serology test confirmed only 12 cases. \"In all the positive cases of dengue, the platelet count was found to be less than 80,000,\" said Trehan.  He said the hospital had already issued an advisory, while patients who are suspected to be carrying the diseases have been told to act with caution. \"The patients have been told not to allow water to stagnate around their houses and also use measures to check growth of mosquitoes,\" he said.  However, Trehan said there was no need to panic as the cases reported at the hospital were only of mild dengue.  According to officials, the hospital is taking blood samples of patients showing symptoms of dengue. Also, reports for the blood tests, carried out at the hospital's laboratory, are being handed to the patients within a few hours.

Among them, six died - some of them from areas adjoining Malegaon. However, the extensive awareness campaign carried out in Malegaon by way of distributing pamphlets and with the aid of clerics and influential people helped the administration tide over the possible outbreaks of the disease,\" Kakade added.\n\n \n\n The DMO, however, announced the outbreak of dengue in the district with as many as 14 cases detected, including four in the city.\n\n \n\n \"Outbreak is announced by the office, either when the number of patients which has been tested positive is more than the population or in cases where there has been a death of the patient suffering from the disease. There were six more locations where the outbreak has been announced, even when there was no death reported,\" the official said, adding that the protocols of all the measures required to arrest the spread of the disease are being followed.\n\n \n\n Of the 15 talukas in the district, outbreaks were announced in Dindori, Niphad, Nandgaon, Peth, Sinnar, Nashik Satana, Igatpuri and Yeola, with Dindori, Peth and Igatpuri being the tribal talukas.\n\n \n\n \n\n"}

XXXXXX &nbsp;&raquo;&nbsp;Nagpur   One suspected dengue death; Wardha man tests positive for swine flu  The writer has posted comments on this article   while a man from Wardha undergoing treatment in the city tested positive for swine flu   on Monday. The 23-year-old man from Karamja, Wardha, was among the three people who were tested in the city for swine flu. He is undergoing treatment at a private hospital for the H1N1   infection. Meanwhile, Netaji Nagar resident Mohammed Nayab Abdul Hakeem (11) tested positive for dengue in the initial hospital-based diagnosis. To confirm the disease, the sample has been sent to Pune based National Institute of Virology (NIV).   Hakeem was first admitted to a hospital in Wardhaman Nagar and later shifted to a private hospital in Ramdaspeth. One of the children in his neighbourhood is undergoing treatment for dengue in a private hospital in Dhantoli. This is what made the doctors think of performing the preliminary test for dengue on him. NMC's medical officer Dr Ashok Urkude said that 24 samples were sent to NIV last month for dengue test while 13 have been sent this month. None of the samples has tested positive, he said. It is difficult to diagnose dengue as many of its symptoms are similar to those of other viral fevers. \"Though the clinical diagnosis for dengue is recognized as standard by the World Health Organisation   (WHO), strangely it is not accepted by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). The civic officials insist on getting the samples tested at NIV before declaring that the disease was responsible for any death,\" said a senior paediatrician from the city. Almost every household in Netaji Nagar slums has people suffering from fever. The residents are now worried about spread of dengue.

A team of doctors from Berhampur visited the village and collected blood samples for testing as the clinical symptoms of the patients pointed to mosquito-borne viral disease.\nRath, however, said there is no need to panic as no fresh case of fever has been reported from the village. A team of doctors, led by district malaria officer (DMO) U S Mishra along with paramedics visited the area two days ago to treat affected persons and sensitise people about the diseases.\n\nThe main reason for outbreak of chikungunya, malaria, dengue and Japanese Encephalitis is water stagnation, in which larve originates and spread infection, said a doctor. People should take steps to prevent water stagnation to prevent breeding of mosquitoes, he added.\n\nThe team also created awareness to destroy stagnant water and dry water-logging spots in the village, said the DMO. \"The diseases are under control as health officials have taken several steps to prevent their spread,\" Mishra said.\n\nWhile the district reported over 500 dengue cases in 2012 around 30 people mostly from Boxipalli, a predominantly fisherman village in the district suffered from chikungunya, Dengue had claimed at least two lives in the district, official sources said."}
