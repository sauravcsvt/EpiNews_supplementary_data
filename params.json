In this manuscript, we introduce 'EpiNews', a generic\r\ntemporal framework that combines supervised temporal topic models with\r\ntime-series regression techniques to monitor and estimate time-varying\r\nincidence of multiple diseases. We validated 'EpiNews' against official \r\ndisease case count reports, as available from public healh agencies, in U.S.,\r\nChina and India. We evaluated 'EpiNews' on multiple \r\ndisease outbreaks in the recent past, such as whooping cough in U.S. (2012),\r\nperiodic outbreaks of avian influenza A (H7N9) and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) \r\nin China (2013 and 2014), dengue outbreaks in China (2014) and India (2013). Given below \r\nare the diseases for which we evaluated 'EpiNews' for U.S., China and India.\r\n\r\n* U.S. - whooping cough, rabies, salmonellosis and E. coli Infection. Time\r\n   period of study: January 2010 to December 2013. Evaluation period for\r\n   disease incidence estimation- January 2012 to December 2013. Official disease case counts\r\n   obtained from Project Tycho (https://www.tycho.pitt.edu/).\r\n\r\n* China - H7N9, HFMD and dengue. Time period of study: January 2013 to\r\n   December 2014. Evaluation period for\r\n   disease incidence estimation- December 2013 to December 2014. Official disease case counts obtained from National Health\r\n   and Family Planning Commission (http://en.nhfpc.gov.cn/).\r\n\r\n* India - acute diarrheal disease (ADD), dengue, malaria. Time period of\r\n   study: January 2013 to December 2014. Evaluation period for\r\n   disease incidence estimation- April 2013 to December 2014. Official disease case counts obtained\r\n   from Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (http://www.idsp.nic.in/).\r\n\r\n## Raw HealthMap data\r\n\r\nWe obtained a corpus of disease-related news articles from HealthMap for each of the 3\r\ncountries - U.S., China and India. For each country, the corpus contains articles related to the\r\ndiseases mentioned above.\r\n\r\n* [Raw HealthMap U.S.](./data/US/raw_HealthMap/)\r\n* [Raw HealthMap China](./data/China/raw_HealthMap/)\r\n* [Raw HealthMap India](./data/India/raw_HealthMap/)\r\n\r\n## Processed HealthMap data\r\n\r\nThe corpus for each country was preprocessed and transformed to a collection of\r\ntuples of the form {w,l,t}: count where count is the number of news articles\r\nmentioning the word w referring to location l at time point t. For each\r\ncountry, the sets of such tuples were provided corresponding to each time point T within the\r\nevaluation period. E.g., for China, the file 'tuple collection-2014-02-01.csv' contains the\r\nset of tuples from t=0 ('2013-01-01') to t=T where T='2014-02-01'.\r\nT='2014-02-01' refers to the month of February 2014. The tuple \"('h7n9',\r\n('China', u'Shandong'), '2013-04-01')\",1 means that the word 'h7n9' was\r\nmentioned in 1 article referring to the province of Shandong in China over the\r\nmonth of April 2013. Similar definition applies to the set of tuple collections\r\nobtained for U.S. and India except the fact that each time point t represents a\r\nperiod of 1 week.\r\n\r\n* [Processed HealthMap U.S.](./data/US/processed_HealthMap/)\r\n* [Processed HealthMap China](./data/China/processed_HealthMap/)\r\n* [Processed HealthMap India](./data/India/processed_HealthMap/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Topic Distributions\r\n\r\nThe first component of 'EpiNews' is a supervised temporal topic model which extracts\r\nlatent disease topics and their associated temporal trends of prominence from\r\nthe set of tuple collections. The temporal topic trends (along with the sampled \r\ncase counts generated via multinomial sampling) for the diseases were provided \r\ncorresponding to each time point T within the evaluation period. \r\n\r\n* [Topic distributions U.S.](./data/US/topic_distributions/)\r\n* [Topic distributions China](./data/China/topic_distributions/)\r\n* [Topic distributions India](./data/India/topic_distributions/)\r\n\r\n## Actual and estimated case counts\r\n\r\nThe second component of 'EpiNews', referred to as 'EpiNews-ARNet', is responsible\r\nfor generating estimates of case counts for each time point T within the \r\nevaluation period using past case counts available from t=0 to t=T-1 and values of \r\ntemporal topic trends available from t=0 to t=T. The case count estimates of 'EpiNews-ARNet' \r\n(along with the baseline methods) and the actual case counts (obtained from official reports) \r\nwere provided for each time point T within the evaluation period.\r\n\r\n* [Case counts U.S.](./data/US/case_counts/)\r\n* [Case counts China](./data/China/case_counts/)\r\n* [Case counts India](./data/India/case_counts/)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
